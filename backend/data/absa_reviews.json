The only thing my prior Samsung Galaxy phone had better than this Motorola e5 phone is photo editing.....a bit harder to do on the Moto e5, but in time I will get used to it.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"This could have been a great smartphone......could have been!!","text":"I needed a replacement Net 10 smartphone as my old  smartphone crapped out on me finally. So I wanted a more up-to-date & larger smartphone that my carrier Net 10 can be used on & I ended up getting this RCA Q1 smartphone. I never knew RCA made smartphones also. I have a decent RCA tablet that works just fine for me. Also, I also ordered a Micro Sim card kit for the phone to be used as a Net 10 smartphone for myself for around $7.  You can use 2 micro Sim cards on this phone. Decent basic smartphone with a nice 5 or 5.5 inch clear sharp display with all the usual smart phone features on it. You can easily add your own micro SD card for additional storage space. I think the internal memory is 12 to 16 gigabytes already. Android Marshmallow version and rather speedy phone for me. It came with a rubberized case you can fit on the phone's backside. It has 2 cameras, one front and one rear side. I think it took maybe 1 to 2 hours tops to get this phone up & running and migrate the apps from the old phone to this RCA smartphone. I have or had one huge issue with this phone.....the cell phone service keeps crapping out on this phone! I can use the apps just fine, but could never make phone calls on this phone. I actually contacted Net 10 customer service by chat 4 different times to get the cellphone service portion working again on this RCA smartphone with very little luck. It would work okay one day and not the next day. I got fed up with this phone...so I transferred my phone number and Sim card to a Plum smartphone....and that one works great!! But that's a different smartphone all-together and I reviewed that Plum smartphone on another review. This RCA smartphone would have been a 5 star phone only if the cellphone part kept working instead of crapping out every other day. 2 star rating.","images":[],"asin":"B01N071CQE","parent_asin":"B01N071CQE","user_id":"AGK75AOJP6GW6GYYDMMIKLWBIMMA","timestamp":1509717189484,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":343,"phone_score":0.6933813691,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.6933813691,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.6933813691,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.6933813691,"service_score":0.6933813691,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.6933813691,"features_score":0.6933813691,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.6933813691,"app_score":0.6933813691,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.6933813691,"size_score":0.0}

Personally, I like this LG cellphone much better than my older Motorola unit. This cellphone is very easy to use, pretty user-friendly menu system, nice ringtones available and nice musical message reminder, and simply a much better basic cellphone compared to my last Motorola unit. This is a 3G cellphone. Making a phone call is easy...flip it open and turn on the phone, dial the number and then press &#34;send&#34;. The battery charges pretty quick. It has a built-in camera with is easy to use with typical cellphone camera quality....tho I am not sure how many megapixels this camera is. And setting up the voice mail message center on this cellphone is easy to set up. If you need a basic non-smart phone cellphone, this LG flip-type cellphone really is a good 3G cellphone to get. Caller ID information shows inside when you open up this flip phone and also on the outer lid also....just the area code & phone number....no name ID information tho.  5 stars on this cellphone simply because it does everything I need it to do without a fuss.","images":[],"asin":"B019MOASM4","parent_asin":"B019MOASM4","user_id":"AGK75AOJP6GW6GYYDMMIKLWBIMMA","timestamp":1463588193000,"helpful_vote":13,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":225,"phone_score":0.8692645431,"battery_score":0.8692645431,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.8692645431,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.8692645431,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.8692645431,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.8692645431,"size_score":0.0}

Because if you just want a touch screen phone without being able to download apps that you can't use well this the phone for you... You can't even watch YouTube videos on it even if you download the app for it... Because you have to update Google Play Service and there is not enough room on the phone to even do that.. You can't watch them by using the browser as well because you need the app to watch YouTube videos on it. It would be different if you was able to download a different browser like Google Chrome.. But you can't even do that... The only thing this phone is good for is to call, text and get on the internet... But getting on the internet on this phone is no different then getting on the internet on a old flip phone...

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A very good cellphone wonderful screen audio and camera","text":"I really like the Sony experia 5 ii.  I have used it for two weeks and I can already give my assessment of this equipment.  It is light and very thin, the body is made of glass and the metal edges make it very easy to hold and it slides easily into any pocket.  It is very slippery so I suggest you put a casing on it as soon as possible.  the volume buttons on Google assistant and camera trigger are all located on the right side of the device I don't like this because they are easily confused and you end up pressing the one you don't want to touch.  When I carry the phone in my pants pocket, if you accidentally pressed a key, the phone emits a vibration letting you know that the accidental touch protection system is activated, this I also see as a negative point because every time I feel the phone vibrate and I think that  it is a notification.  The screen is very good, it looks excellent and the colors are vibrant especially in videos and photos.  The minimum and maximum brightness are excellent in my opinion.  A very good screen that makes you enjoy multimedia content to the fullest.  The phone has a flagship processor from last year the sd 865 but does not have 5 g networks which leaves it behind other rivals.  This device opens all applications very fast and I have never lagged or frozen.  Very good connectivity wifi Bluetooth antennas everything works wonderful.  The battery lasts all day with moderate use, I am very happy in this regard.  The cameras take beautiful photos in good light conditions, nothing to envy to other flagship equipment on the market at night, they are good but I think they lack a little more detail.  I am not very passionate about shooting videos but I have no doubt that they are very good too.  Conclusions this phone is one of the best I have tried this year apart from the fact that it lacks access to 5g networks, it is a device that is very enjoyed to listen to music due to its hight audio quality, watching videos is very pleasant because of the excellent battery screen that meets  with long use and a processor and ram memory that make it fly when opening games and applications.  I highly recommend it if you like slimmer phones and smaller than most of the ones available on the market.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715nTfBwlML._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715nTfBwlML._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/715nTfBwlML._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71XymObycsL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71XymObycsL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71XymObycsL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71yCoU3OBqL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71yCoU3OBqL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71yCoU3OBqL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B08JCWLB3B","parent_asin":"B08JCWLB3B","user_id":"AG7QVV3NBCA3FB35XOIGKFMH4RLQ","timestamp":1614738080746,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":415,"phone_score":0.673115015,"battery_score":0.673115015,"screen_score":0.673115015,"camera_score":0.673115015,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.673115015,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.673115015,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.673115015,"memory_score":0.673115015,"app_score":0.673115015,"wifi_score":0.673115015,"cell_score":0.673115015,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Is a tool is a phone is a awesome","text":"This smartphone is designed for a specific user.  It is built sturdy and is really heavy.  The excellent screen have a quality and the colors are adequate I only wish the minimum brightness was lower.  The viewing angles are very good I expected less from this phone.  The processor and the memory ran are  efficient which allows you to do anything without delay.  The front camera is decent but not great meets its objective for occasional photos, the rear cameras are good and take clear photos.  This phone has sensors to take photos with zero light, that is, without flash.  When you take the photo from a short distance, they come out clearly despite having absolute darkness but when you try to take it with more than 10 feet the photo is completely bad.  The battery is a strong point in this equipment I have been able to use them for 4 days with intense use without having to recharge it.  This device is not to show your friends as the most beautiful phone but if you work in construction making deliveries or rescuing people this equipment is ideal.  I forget to say that you can attach a flashlight or ultraviolet light to this equipment to disinfect surfaces that in these times of pandemic will be very useful, the bad thing is that these accessories are not included in the box. This phone is water dust and drop resistent all the charging port and memory have protection rubber. In general, oukitel wp7 is more than a smartphone, it is a tool for daily use in extreme and external conditions.  I recommend it to people who are going to use it for tasks that require conditions that another phone cannot handle.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/712VUQKS2XL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/712VUQKS2XL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/712VUQKS2XL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JE9Nt3DlL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JE9Nt3DlL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JE9Nt3DlL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71b2fvjNKvL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71b2fvjNKvL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71b2fvjNKvL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71oWBCB8OYL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71oWBCB8OYL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71oWBCB8OYL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81ZXBNHUOaL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81ZXBNHUOaL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81ZXBNHUOaL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B08BYGLKRY","parent_asin":"B08BYGLKRY","user_id":"AG7QVV3NBCA3FB35XOIGKFMH4RLQ","timestamp":1612664971378,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":290,"phone_score":0.9262631536,"battery_score":0.9262631536,"screen_score":0.9262631536,"camera_score":0.9262631536,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.9262631536,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.9262631536,"memory_score":0.9262632728,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.9262632728,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"I Love This Phone!","text":"The RAZR Flip is a really nice phone. Small, with a unique look. The battery life is decent but I understand why it's not great. I have always loved Motorola and I really wanted a RAZR for the longest time but the old RAZR's didn't really offer up all that many features. So I had to get a Samsung Blade instead. Finally I have a RAZR phone! The phone is easy to use and setup. The screen has a weird feel at certain points but you get uses to it. I understand why it has those bending points though. I really wish the upgraded RAZR 5G supported Verizon's 5G but it doesn't. So I will stick with this older version until Motorola upgrades that phone to support Verizon's 5G or they come out with the RAZR 3. The only thing I do not like about this phone is that it uses an ESIM and that it's locked to Verizon's network. So I can't simply swap a SIM and I can't use it with any other carrier. Those are the only things I think this phone fails on. Other then that, I would recommend this phone and especially Motorola.","images":[],"asin":"B08HZG98P5","parent_asin":"B08HZG98P5","user_id":"AEODE35PX7IJBA5OUX5GOIA7MPIA","timestamp":1673116551941,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":198,"phone_score":0.9324838519,"battery_score":0.9324839711,"screen_score":0.9324838519,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.9324839711,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.9324838519,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9324839711,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Same-Old, Same-Old. Treo 600, I mean Centro....","text":"I like the Treo Centro. It runs on the very dependable Sprint CDMA\/EV-DO network. But it is the same phone as the Treo 600 that came out back in 2003. Palm decided that since the 600 was such a big success, that they had no need to make any kind of effort in designing a new phone. This holds true with the Centro. This phone has the (((SAME))) hardware as the Treo 600, 650, 700, 750, ect. Just a bit more memory and a so-called updated OS. The OS might have an update number of 5.4.9, but there is zero difference in the OS. I can not tell a difference at all. This is sad seeing as they made a Lunix based OS called Cobalt years ago and it has never seen the light of day.<br \/>The Centro still has the same bugs as every Treo since the 600. Start-up time is very slow. Which is really bad when you are in need of making an important phone call, and the phone resets for no reason. Making you wait up to 60+ seconds for it to come back online. The limited RAM of 64MB's, is so much lower then most PDA's currently on the market. You can use ZLaucher to transfer programs to a memory card, but this can not be done with all software. And since the web browser uses RAM, not memory cards, you still only have 8MB's to work with in Blazer. All software must be loaded into RAM before being it can run, So prepare for the phone to reset at least once a day to get the those limited RAM resources back.<br \/>Still no WiFi, which was the complaint in 2003 and Palm has not added it yet. The Centro still has the same 312 MHz Intel XScale processor. Signal strength is still pretty strong, but voice quality is still not great when compared to every other phone I have used before.<br \/><br \/>Sprint is marketing this as an affordable PDA at $99 with a contract. But when you know that the hardware is going on 5 years old, price really doesn't make current PDA owners care a whole lot. I bought the Centro because I hated my Motorola RAZR 2 and I needed to get something better. But after using the Centro for over a month now, I see no difference what-so-ever in this PDA and the Treo 600 and 650 that I owned a few years ago. Smaller packaging, but the same phone. The Centro is a good example of what a PDA maker SHOULD NOT DO. While Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, HTC, ect have all updated their lineups with powerful PDA's, Palm has sat idly by doing nothing with their forum star power. Palm used to control a huge chuck of the PDA software market, but now Microsoft has caught up and passed PalmOS by. No new companies have used PalmOS. Let me rephrase that, NO ONE is using the PalmOS anymore; except for Palm.<br \/>So if you don't have a PDA and want an affordable one, then the Centro might be for you. If you want power, then Sprint has much better PDA's then the aged and milked-to-death Treo's.<br \/>More then likely the Centro will be the last PDA-Phone ever made by Palm. They have lost crazy amounts of market share and have been laying off employees. So who knows, maybe the Centro will be a collectors item. A PDA that has never evolved, never been fixed, never been changed in any, meaningful way.Treo","images":[],"asin":"B000X1HCEI","parent_asin":"B000X1HCEI","user_id":"AEODE35PX7IJBA5OUX5GOIA7MPIA","timestamp":1198293498000,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":592,"phone_score":0.816650033,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.816650033,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.816650033,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.816650033,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.816650033,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

It is odd that they merged with Nextel, because they are my second favorite.<br \/><br \/>Sprint's native network reaches over 250 Million POP. That, with the roaming, their network reaches 290(Digital only phones) or 295(Digital and analog phones) people. that makes it the largest Wireless network in the USA.<br \/><br \/>You get to roam on Verizon's, ALLTEL's, ect networks for free as well.<br \/><br \/>Sprint only offers Unlimited data plans. They offer them for both their Visions and Power Visions access. Prices range from $10 to $25. $25 being the Unlimited Power Visions (EV-DO) access with all of the Sprint TV channels and some Sirius satellite radio, along with other streaming radio channels. Other content can be added, but you would need to check the list. They are always adding new things.<br \/><br \/>Sprint is the only carrier that will let you use your Smart-Device like a Treo 650 with the unlimited Handset data plans. So with Sprint you can use the Unlimited Data on your Treo 650 for $10 a month. Both Verizon and Cingular charge $45 a month for this. T-Mobile $20.<br \/><br \/>They also allow their customers to use their phones as modems, with moderate use. Other carriers either do not have this feature, or have it shut off.<br \/><br \/>Sprint has also added Free Incoming plans to their Fair & Flexible plans. These are plans that keep adding new minutes to your plan, as you go over your bucket.<br \/><br \/>this keeps you from paying 45 to 60 cents a minute in overages. Also keep in mind that other carriers charge roaming and long distance fee's on top of the overage fees. So you can be paying into the $2 dollar a minute range for going over your plan minutes. T-Mobile USA is notorious for this. You pay a fee for the overage minutes, a fee for the long distance, and a fee if roaming. T-Mobile USA's network is pretty small, so you could roaming easily.<br \/><br \/>Another thought to throw around. Is Sprint uses 1900MHz signals for their CDMA\/EV-DO coverage. They are also building out their 800MHz coverage with the licenses acquired from Nextel. Since 1900MHz needs more towers to cover a given area, this allows your phone to have more tower choices to choose from.<br \/><br \/>This also increases Internet speeds, because speeds drop with distance.<br \/><br \/>So I have found Sprint's data speeds to be faster then Verizon's. And Much faster then Cingular's and T-Mobile's Internet speeds.<br \/><br \/>Sprint also uses Lockline for their replacement insurance provider. They cover Any phone on your account, purchased from Anywhere, no matter if it is New or Used. Other carriers insurance providers only cover new phones purchased from the carrier.<br \/><br \/>I could go on and on, but just take this into consideration before choosing another carrier just based on a commercial. Or the bucket of minutes they \"Claim\" they are going to provide you. Minutes don't mean a thing if the network is not dependable and the calls sound like crap.<br \/><br \/>Also keep in mind that Sprint uses CDMA, which is the same network technology Verizon uses.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Decent Phone , Good Customer service.","text":"Over all I am satisfied with the product, even though my experience shows there are some quality problems with this phone.<br \/>  I ordered one and received it, but the phone was Dead On Arrival. I talked to BLU customer service who verified it was dead, but because I purchased from amazon I had to go back to them to replace it.<br \/>  BLU answered the phone quickly, and were nice knowledgeable people. Amazon gave me a return, and did ship the replacement immediately.<br \/>  The second phone I received worked fine, but the charger unit was dead.. the USB cord was fine , and the phone charged fine off other chargers I have. Once again I talked to BLU customer service who immediately sent me a new charger.  Again I have to say BLU customer service was pleasant to talk to, Friendly and Knowledgeable and they solved the problem. I now have a phone that works well.<br \/>  So overall The phone itself I would give a 4 to due to the early quality problems, But overall I would rate the experience well, so I'll give a 5 to the Review.<br \/>  On to the phone: It is what it is - an inexpensive GSM phone that has blue tooth and wireless I had to get a micro sim to fit it, but With T-Mobile that was no problem.  It runs Android 9 not 10, but that is in the description and unless you need some odd app that only runs on 10 , or you are hung up on \u201cmust have the latest\u201d, this is a good phone. The second phone has worked well now for a month, with no problems. I am impressed with the battery, a full charge can last me for two to three days.( I don't use the phone a lot, I live on a computer, not the phone.)

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great if you have a tablet, since you won't necessarily need a smartphone.","text":"I actually purchased this to replace a Nokia Lumia 920 smartphone--one of the most powerful on the market, and imo much superior to any iPhone, hands-down.<br \/><br \/>I later bought a Nexus 7 (2013 October version) and soon realized that all the features on my smartphone were pretty much redundant. The Nexus, being an extremely powerful tablet mostly suited for gaming, has no issues at all running anything on the Android market, or on Google Play.<br \/><br \/>After that, my smartphone had no real use for the prefix part of that, and all I was really using it for was the phone part. So, obviously, it made sense to just drop it and its astonishingly high mandatory data rates and get something that did the only thing I really needed it to do: Send and receive calls, texts, and sometimes emails.<br \/><br \/>Since smartphones are becoming staggeringly expensive (especially if you're still an iPhone user, in which case you probably just go with familiarity since the phone hasn't really improved since the 4 [Siri was already on Android phones long before then, not that it was all that useful to begin with]) and also have new problems, like practically mandatory external chargers (ATT treats these as a casual given that they're happy to sell you, like it's somehow okay that the things can't even be used for one day without being recharged), abysmal battery life, poor voice quality in favor of data speeds, and basically, tons of stuff you *HAVE* to pay for that practically no one really needs. Data plans are only going up in price, and how \"smart\" do you really need a smartphone to be? At what point is it just a mini-computer and only secondarily a phone?<br \/><br \/>Anyway, if you're like me and just said no to the smartphone boom that made cell phone bills shoot through the damned exosphere while *sacrificing* basic features older phones had (such as, say, working for the entire freaking day with normal use, and acting like having secondary chargers has always been the case), phones like these are really the way to go. Use your tablet for the tough stuff, it's far better at it, anyway. And less expensive, so long as you just use Wi-Fi for your data.<br \/><br \/>If you want a small computer that doesn't even bother acting like it's technically a phone, knock yourself out and get an expensive smartphone. If you're a little smarter than that, get a tablet (they're now far more affordable and even sub-$200 ones are more than adequate for most people--and they don't have contracts) and a phone that acts like it's really a phone. You'll save a ridiculous amount of money in the long run and end up better off than you were before even if cost wasn't the motivator. Smartphones are so battery-craving and in many practical ways no better off than before, so they're really just absurd with the advent of contract-free, inexpensive tablets.<br \/><br \/>I hope these things come back as viable options for people instead of the all-the-way-downhill iPhones of today that still dominate the market exclusively due to familiarity with the brand (it's true: Everything an iPhone has ever done has been done before on Android, bar nothing at all except the mechanism that makes it more expensive). Joy to the world when something like the Razrs come back and we go back to having practical technology instead of cool-but-pragmatically-worthless technologies on phones.","images":[],"asin":"B005KME38I","parent_asin":"B005KME38I","user_id":"AGOGAJT6O6ZPDD5BZ5AZRCFBAAXQ","timestamp":1382316389000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":579,"phone_score":0.5207347274,"battery_score":0.5207347274,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.5207347274,"phones_score":0.5207347274,"life_score":0.5207347274,"quality_score":0.5207347274,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.5207347274,"case_score":0.5207347274,"features_score":0.5207347274,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.5207347274,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.5207347274,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Pretty good price for a little android phone","text":"I upgraded from a LG 840g (which was a dumb phone, they both have the same screen size) I buy a new burner every year with 3x minutes 1200 and 1 year of service.<br \/>I looked at all the tracfone androids out there, this one had 4.4 os, and decent processing, etc. so went with this. I&#34;m not the kind of person who blows over $100 on a cell phone. This + 1yr service was $120, a pretty good deal, since the 840 was $95 with 1 yr svc.<br \/><br \/>About the &#34;smart phone&#34; upgrade, meh, there are some features and apps that are cool, I can load skype and use it over wifi, texting is a lot easier\/better than the last phone. They are both very close in size. My gripe is I hate google and all the crap they do half-cocked. their idea of integration is very sketchy. like signing up for spam and spying 24\/7. Apps don't shut themselves off, so you have to go under settings&#62;battery&#62; and shut everything off manually or else they keep running... using up memory and battery.<br \/><br \/>Seeing how small this is, I would have liked a bigger phone, but low price won out. I use my ipad for apps, surfing, and media and I love it!<br \/><br \/>Coolest thing I've found so far on this phone, I can have caller ID and text messages read automatically, ha ha, I don't even have to pick it up, it just says for example, &#34;text message from Jimmies - your pizza is ready for pickup&#34;<br \/><br \/>Getting my contacts loaded from my MBP was a cinch: exported contacts to vcard, sent vcard via bluetooth to the phone after paring it, somehow i can't remember- found the file sent and imported into contacts. took about 5 minutes to do the whole process!<br \/><br \/>Trying to surf the web on this is a total joke. Everything is mis-sized and way too small.<br \/><br \/>gmail is crap, box full of spam, so I will only use it for password resetting stuff like that and an account at goggle play to get free apps.<br \/><br \/>FYI: PROMO CODES FOR BONUS MINUTES DON'T APPLY TO ANDROID PHONES. I even called tracfone to get the extra 250 minutes added, nope sorry! but with the triple minutes\/text\/data per the android phones, which comes out to be way more than 250 standard minutes on the 840, I still come out ahead.<br \/><br \/>I highly recommend going to the tracfone website and checking out the animated tutorial for this phone, covers the basics.","images":[],"asin":"B00NVQ19NW","parent_asin":"B00NVQ19NW","user_id":"AHV35WJ6IJ2HNIPCUWWHONEVOQKA","timestamp":1415905233000,"helpful_vote":93,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":431,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Almost perfect but can't continue using","text":"Update. The company contacted me and offered to remedy my situation so i added another star for customer service.<br \/>This phone is practically perfect for my needs.<br \/>It has a super long battery life and the features are easy to use.<br \/>The FLIR app is fascinating and fun to play with.  There are other useful \"tools\" such as a protractor, compass, decibel sound meter and gradienter that I like to play with also.<br \/>This phone is heavy and rugged just as described. I call it \"Chunk\" because its so bulky but that doesn't bother me at all. Just wanted to let others know, this is not a dainty girly phone.<br \/>I've dropped it with zero issues. I believe it can handle way more than what I can do to damage it, which says a lot.<br \/>Unfortunately, I need to move to a different phone for a couple of reasons, and I'm seriously bummed about it.<br \/>First, the phone does not stay connected to any Bluetooth device. Headphones will play for a random amount of time and just stop. I stream all day everyday and have tried different speakers along with headphones and it does the same thing with every one. This is the biggest issue I have with the phone and why I will not be able to use it anymore. I can't stop what I'm doing all day to walk back to the phone and start the program again to play in my headphones.<br \/>Second, the phone is set up in a way that my carrier, xfinity, does not support the phone. I had to get hooked in with ATT paying almost $70 a month while the other 2 phones on Xfinity are less than $100 monthly together. If I go back onto the Xfinity plan, ill only be paying $20\/month more... This is also a problem because I live in a terrible signal area. Xfinity service worked so much better than the ATT does.  If the phone worked with bluetooth, I would pay the extra money but I can't justify the cost when it doesn't properly stream to my devices.<br \/>I hope this helps.","images":[],"asin":"B09J56QF2W","parent_asin":"B09J56QF2W","user_id":"AG32FVH2WCSFZTIJYSV76LXTUHDQ","timestamp":1653918002374,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":356,"phone_score":0.9826075435,"battery_score":0.9826075435,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.9826075435,"life_score":0.9826075435,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.9826075435,"battery life_score":0.9826075435,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9826075435,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.9826075435,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9826075435,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good enough for me","text":"When you're coming from a nightmare situation, almost anything better is good.<br \/><br \/>I am a recovering BLU Products user. After 3 years and 8 devices (only 2 of those are user-related replacements) I'm done. Their recent madness with the Life One X2 led me to search for a decent replacement, which led me here.<br \/><br \/>I knew I wouldn't find something with the same operating power as the Life One X2 (64GB memory 4GB RAM) at a similar price, but I was gonna try. The Moto's memory was enough for me. I back up all my photos to Google and I've never got to 32GB memory before, so the extra memory in my phone was just sitting there. The only thing I was gonna miss was RAM.<br \/><br \/>So yeah, it's a little noticeable, but not much. Not enough to make me want to take it back, and definitely not enough for me to go back to my life one x2. I like the design of the phone, the layout, Android 7 is awesome.<br \/><br \/>The prime ads aren't bad. I'm adding screenshots of what happens when I use the fingerprint sensor vs turning on via the power button.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>~five across apps, very nice, can fit all my apps I use regularly on one screen<br \/>~night mode: blue filtering, great for migraine sufferers<br \/>~5000mAh battery: guys, THIS is worth everything!! I'm a super heavy user and I get at least a full day of use. Hubby is a light user and can get 2 or more days without charging.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>~back door: seriously, I broke two nails and almost quit between installing SIM cards for mine and hubby's phones. If it weren't gonna damage the door I would've used a knife.<br \/>~speed: it's something I'm just gonna have to get used to.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Avoid Boost Mobile like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","text":"I decided to write this review for two reasons:  (1) To warn everyone about Boost Mobile, and (2) Hoping that someone might have the same problem I am having now and can provide some help.<br \/><br \/>This review concerns my whole Boost Mobile experience.  Here goes!<br \/><br \/>I purchased the phone because Boost Mobile has a great $35 unlimited talk, text, and web (2.5 Gb at high-speed 4G LTE) and Hotspot capability for $5 for 1 Gb of data (in addition to the phone's allocation).<br \/><br \/>I went to the Boost Mobile website, created my account, and activated the phone.  The phone appeared to work OK, but the data was only 3G.  I called Boost Mobile customer service.  I have to warn you... the 800 number is nothing short of voice-mail hell!!  The options given only run you in a circle.  You can talk to a customer service agent only if you want to &#34;add a service.&#34;  All other options are just information that never leads you to a real person.<br \/><br \/>Once you reach a customer service agent, you must be able to speak Filipino-ish.  You will NOT (even if you demand it) be able to speak with a Customer Service Supervisor in the United States!!  No matter how much you scream at the Filipino operator.  It's not going to happen!!!<br \/><br \/>The first agent told me that the $35 plan would only provide 3G data.  I told him, &#34;According to your website, the service is 4G LTE until 2.5 Gb and then slows to 3G speeds.&#34;  He told me that the site was wrong.  I hung up and called another operator (wading through voice-mail hell again).  This operator spoke clearer English and told me the first operator was wrong.  I did all of the normal &#34;reboot&#34; and &#34;refresh&#34; crap with nothing helping the situation.  I finally gave up, wiped my information, and took the phone back to the store.  Oh well, another surprise was to be had.  The phone can't be returned once activated!  NICE!!<br \/><br \/>Since I had already paid for one month of service, I decided to &#34;reboot&#34; and &#34;refresh&#34; the phone.  Still 3G!!  I did notice that the phone would show five bars for 20 seconds and then zero bars with a red &#34;x.&#34;  It would cycle through this 3G, five bars, no bars with a red &#34;x&#34; about every minute.  When out and about, the phone would do the same thing.  I felt that the phone having reception and losing reception was a bit dangerous... after all, most of us have our phones for emergencies while we travel!!  Finally, I found an option to switch the phone to CDMA only.  This keeps service at all times and the &#34;off and on&#34; information mentioned above stops.  Also, I had to turn the &#34;Connection Optimizer&#34; off in order to keep the phone from switching back to &#34;LTE\/CDMA&#34; mode.<br \/><br \/>Remember that I mentioned that I purchased the phone for hot spot use?  Well, if I log into my account, the hot spot are &#34;grayed out.&#34;  A banner near the hot spot information says &#34;Options are grayed out because account is in restricted status.&#34;  Nobody (and I mean NO ONE) at Boost Mobile can tell me what this means, why it's on my screen, and why I can't add hot spot service!!!!  Apparently there is no Filipino-ish translation for &#34;restricted status.&#34;<br \/><br \/>I have to add that I went to a local Boost Mobile store.  I should have known there was a problem when I walked up to the store and noticed the bars on the windows!!  :)  I felt like I was stepping into a third-world country when I walked in the store! ha ha ha ha  The person there told me the phone was broken and it should have been receiving 4G data.  Hmmm....  Perhaps this &#34;expert&#34; is not really an expert at all!!  He made the diagnosis with the phone in CDMA mode.  I would have thought he would have checked the mode FIRST!!  Oh well, who am I?  Certainly no Boost Mobile LG Volt expert! :)<br \/><br \/>So, now I have a beautiful phone that can't do the two things I purchased it to do!!<br \/><br \/>I would stay away from this company.  The lack of any customer service and ability to resolve problems has turned me against the company!!  I could have purchased the same phone (LG Realm - 3G only) for $70 less than I paid for this phone!!!!!<br \/><br \/>You have been warned!!!  :)","images":[],"asin":"B00K8CS8VS","parent_asin":"B00K8CS8VS","user_id":"AGMMOOBYAGNBJSOAJUX6AKOQ5GOQ","timestamp":1427378900000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":754,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Low Budget Smartphone","text":"Had this phone for a little over a month now after using two different Tracfones. It is definitely a step-up from those. Bigger screen, more responsive touchscreen, better internet reception, better camer7a and video , more readily available apps. I'm absolutely loving it, and find it tough to put down at times. Doesn't have that many preloaded apps like Samsung or the IPad, but honestly don't think those can do much more than this phone. I even like the cases that are available for it.<br \/><br \/>Now a sticking point for some may be the data that is available for it now. Boost offers 3 standard option for calls, texts, and data. Calls and texts are unlimited on all 3 options far as can tell. 35$ give you 1GB of data. 45$ gets you 5GB of data. 55$ gets you a whopping 10GB of data. Didn't see any other competitors offering 10GB at the time. Appears T Mobile may have joined the party recently. Although 10GB sounds like an awful lot of data, it really isn't. Phone worked almost seamless when I had it, but once your data reaches its limit, Boost drops your speed from 4G to 3G. The phone doesn't work nearly as well at 3G,  and videos won't really play at the 2G they get dropped too. I think it's important for new buyers to understand this. I think they should also understand that this phone uses up data in pretty healthy chunks. I went through 10GB in about 2 weeks, and I didn't play one video game or watch any full length movies. Pretty much convinced all data plans are a scam to get you to add more money or buy more cards. I digress though. Boost does have an option for 30$ on auto-pay that gives 2GB, which is what I'm now on. Didn't see a need to buy all that extra time that'll be gone in an instant anyway.<br \/><br \/>Despite that data issues, I still love this phone. At 3GB the phone still works pretty effectively as long as you don't do any gaming on it or stream anything longer than a few minutes. For those things, you probably do need an IPad or Samsung.<br \/><br \/>Would like to add as of June 13, 2016, Boost now offers unlimited Data for $60, with it dropping to $55 if you use the automatic payment (autopay) option. The 10GB option for $55 is now gone. $45\/$40autopay still gives you 5gb. $35\/$30autopay now gives you 2gb.","images":[],"asin":"B00RLUQGHS","parent_asin":"B00RLUQGHS","user_id":"AEHF3KA7KW7AHWWAZODCA55A34IA","timestamp":1440001620000,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":420,"phone_score":0.9803104997,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.9803104997,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.9803104997,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.9803104997,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.9803104997,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9803104997,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Price\/performance point is OUTSTANDING!","text":"I traded up from a Pixel 3XL. Just about everything on the LG G8X is better. There is no pause when launching or using apps. A good non-productive example is with the CoC game. The loading progress line with the 3XL would pause for several seconds at about 75%. With the G8X the progress line shoots across the screen with no perceptible hesitation! All apps are noticeably quicker. The dual screen is really a novelty for me. For now, I don't use any apps that take advantage of it. However, It is a great bundle price vs. the G8X by itself. So, I see it as an investment until more dual screen apps are available. As far as size goes with the dual screen, its footprint is actually smaller than my old 3XL with its case protector. Plus, it only weighs 3 grams more than the 3XL with case. I don't notice any difference! I was concerned about the fingerprint reader from all the negative reviews. And, they were right. If you use the screen reader exactly like your old physical reader, it is terrible. That was until I noticed that the position of my thumb when training the reader was way different from how I positioned it while in use. After re-training the reader from my \"use\" position, the reader is very reliable. Not quite as much as my old 3XL reader which was virtually 100%, but close. I go an entire a week without a \"bad\" read. Let me offer some tips. Have clean hands. No big deal in these China virus days. You should already be doing this. As said before, place your thumb (or finger) in the same orientation as when it was learned. Again, no big deal since holding your phone is pretty much the same each time. And finally, do not press your thumb down hard on the screen. I don't know if this causes the print to be flattened (smeared) or if the touchscreen thinks it is responding to a navigation command, but a light touch seems to always work. The other great feature is the battery life. My 3XL's battery would often not last the full day for me. The G8X will have 60% battery left when I put it down at night. Outstanding!<br \/>So, no regrets. Awesome phone and nerdy, gadget dual screen, which I hope gets more apps. Even if it doesn't, it is still cheaper and better than phones that cost hundreds more.

I could not get it to sync with my laptop with Windows 98.  You need Windows 98 SE or ME or above.  Solved the problem by buying a new laptop $$$.<br \/>2.  If you're a woman with fingernails, you'll need the carrying case. The rounded smooth plastic buttons on the keyboard are difficult to use without the vynle cover.<br \/>3.  The reception is no where nearly as clear as the digital phones.  The reception from my bedroom is at best, really bad.<br \/>4.  You'll spend another small sum on the protable keyboard, cradle, sync cable for travel, car recharger, a second charger and cradle for the office and memory.<br \/>5.  Learn to back up your data.  If your Treo crashes, you'll hear yourself letting out a gutteral scream that you didn't know was in you.<br \/>6.  If you're storing pics and lots of data, you'll need more memory sooner than later.<br \/>7.  Get a hands free earpeace so you can be on the phone and look at your calendar and contacts.<br \/>8.  Join a support group for others who want to lynch the techies who write the manuals for these things.  It'll take a couple of cups of strong coffee and an 30 minutes before you end up taking the dog out for a walk.<br \/>9.  The stylus unscrews to reveal a pointy end to reset your Treo if it freezes.  The Tech line is never open when your Treo gets stuck and it's making a loud clicking sound.  Plus, when it freezes, you can't get the help number that is stored on your Treo.  Tatoo it on your forearm, it'll be more useful.<br \/>10.  There is no \"OFF\" button for the Treo and yes, it will freeze on you.<br \/>11.  You cannot drive and use the Treo like your cell phone, you'll be risking your life and the life of every other dirver on the road if you try to type, send an email, or update a contact or calendar entry.<br \/>12.  There is no spell check, so expect that most of your emails will be gibberish or unintentionally funny.<br \/>13.

I've had it for a week now, and as a light to middle-weight phone user, I'm very satisfied.  Snappy performance, plenty of RAM and storage, and a full battery charge can last me over 2 days.  The rear camera is good, the action camera is great.  It has NFC, it's unlocked for the US carriers, it can take an SD card.  I wasn't sure if I'd be crazy about be the weird dimensions or punch-hole front camera, but I discovered that I actually really like the elongated shape and don't mind the front camera at all.  It also seems to go on sale frequently.  It was a really good value at $250, and nearly impossible to beat at $200.<br \/><br \/>I read some discussion on the internet about how the touchscreen seems to miss some folks' rapid finger taps, like when typing.

It did miss some touches with the standard new-in-box plastic screen cover in place though (the one you're supposed to remove anyway), so I would suggest if you use a screen protector, go with tempered glass.","images":[],"asin":"B07WJJFKYW","parent_asin":"B07WJJFKYW","user_id":"AGWV5YLPBOF4Y54WFCWNENSPQ57Q","timestamp":1595698675381,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":220,"phone_score":0.9049028754,"battery_score":0.9049028754,"screen_score":0.9049028754,"camera_score":0.9049028754,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9049028754,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I would compare it to a 60s muscle car 4speed stick with all modern suspension(comes with android 10) and a new big block(6ma 2 day battery life).

{"rating":5.0,"title":"So far so good","text":"So, I've had this for about an hour now and this is all based on that initial experience. Will update if anything goes awry later, but... Setup was seamless! Just log into your google account from your old and new phone, then follow the prompts. It'll take a while for OS updates and your apps to download and install, but it does that all in the background. Came with about half a battery, so I was able to get going immediately. Honestly, with the cases off, it's maybe 30% thicker than my old Galaxy S8 with a cracked screen, which isn't a problem at all. I LOVE the color of the back. I've seen a few complaints about the included case, and well... Mine is fine! It's probably not the case I'd get, as I'd prefer something sleeker and may be buying a new one, but this one is thick, fits snugly, and it seems like it will provide outstanding protection for this phone. So far it's running quickly, I've been logging back into all of my accounts. There are probably a few utilities that aren't great or that I'll miss from my Galaxy, but the beauty of Android is that ALL of that is customizable. There are tons of alternative calling, messaging, firewall, antivirus, camera, gallery, and file manager apps on the market, which I'll be exploring in the coming weeks as I use this more, but stock Android is also very usable without tons of customization. I'll miss the NFC and Qi wireless charging that this phone doesn't have, but for a ~$100 temporary\/backup phone, those aren't completely necessary.<br \/><br \/>Update: I ended up needing the NFC for my blood glucose meter, so I had to replace the phone, but I'm still using it daily. It's a great device to carry around while I'm working on projects and listening to music. Since my SIM is in my main phone, this one is basically an iPod touch. I've used it for the past 4 days straight on WIFI with Bluetooth turned on, listening to music and the battery is only now at 59%. It's a slow charge, but also lasts FOREVER on a charge! Gives me the opportunity to work on projects without distractions from my regular phone constantly buzzing to tell me about something that I \"might\" want to know about. Works well using Youtube and Twitter and connects to all of my stuff really reliably. It's also very lightweight and I love that the headphone jack is on top.","images":[],"asin":"B0843HCT63","parent_asin":"B0843HCT63","user_id":"AFQORXBQGE76P75ANEERDXAW63YA","timestamp":1600455294426,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":422,"phone_score":0.742729187,"battery_score":0.742729187,"screen_score":0.742729187,"camera_score":0.742729187,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.742729187,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.742729187,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.742729187,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.7427291274,"wifi_score":0.742729187,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"but I was annoyed enough by the limitation of stock Android that I ...","text":"tl;dr -<br \/>This phone is incredible, but I was annoyed enough by the limitation of stock Android that I returned the Amazon Prime exclusive version (on which you cannot unlock the bootloader) and bought the standard edition.<br \/><br \/>Full -<br \/>I was a cheapskate and decided to buy the Amazon Prime exclusive version to save $60.  If you're okay with stock Android and you don't care about playing with settings, there's nothing wrong with that edition.  Honestly, the ads on the lock screen didn't bother me.  They full screen when you have no notifications, and slot in as the last notification slot if you do.  Once you unlock the phone, they're gone until the next lock screen.<br \/><br \/>The only real modifications Moto has made to Android for this phone are built into a special Moto app, which allows a couple of tweaks.  The main settings concern inertial gestures (which allow you to open the camera or turn on the flashlight by moving the phone in certain ways), and fingerprint gestures (which replace the intrusive software navigation bar with swiping left for back, right for recents, or tapping for home).  You can also disable the obnoxious boot sound.  Everything in this app is great, they did a really good job in centralizing the non-standard tweaks and making them actually useful.<br \/><br \/>The rest of the Android experience is pretty stock.  The launcher is a slightly modified version of the Pixel Launcher, where they've only put a custom lock screen in and made the app drawer transparent, both of which are tasteful.  All of the other settings are basic Nougat, which makes the interface very efficient.  However, if you don't like the white background in all of the menus and Android apps, it can glare at you a bit, and you cannot apply themes to the whole interface without unlocking the bootloader and rooting the phone.<br \/><br \/>As far as hardware goes,  the battery life is unbelievable.  I've yet to see less than around half charge by the end of a day, it lasts forever.  Turbo charging is also a nice feature, and lets you emergency charge your phone quickly when you only have access to power for a short period of time.  No NFC, but that's pretty typical of a mid-range phone, and I don't really miss it.  I'm never going to run out of RAM or storage (4GB\/64GB model).  The graphics processor is very zippy and keeps up with that octa-core processor nicely.  I've noticed no lag under really any circumstances.  The camera's nice, pretty on par with what's available in the rest of the market, and not much to be said about it.  The brightness and color of the dual-tone flash comes through well on the camera, and makes for a very visible flash light.  The screen is nice, good contrast in the sun, and dim enough at night that I don't blind myself.  It's &#34;only&#34; full HD, not 4K, to give those of you who like to text with a microscope something to complain about, but for us mere mortals the resolution is perfect.<br \/><br \/>The radios are sensitive and reliable.  I get LTE with decent consistency in my apartment, where my old Zenfone 2 couldn't with the same SIM.  I like having dual-band WiFi, as I can finally put everything on my 5 GHz network and clear up some 2.4 GHz interference.  There's no Wireless-AC, but how much are you really downloading on your phone?  Bluetooth has been pretty reliable, nothing out of the ordinary.<br \/><br \/>Ultimately, the only reason I was unhappy with the particular phone I got (seriously, the ONLY reason) was the permalocked bootloader.  I've now switched up to the standard version (which I only booted on stock Android long enough to toggle the developer switch for bootloader unlocking), and running AOKP, I couldn't be happier.  The extra features that really make this phone nice for me were theming, the ability to tether (this is a carrier limitation for me which can be overridden with aftermarket ROMs), and manual control of whether to use LTE or 3G since I drive for work and end up in some places with weird reception.  If none of these are important to you, there's no reason you'll be disatisfied with this phone.  It's probably the best phone you can get in this price range, and with the cross-network compatibility, you don't have to worry about switching carriers if you move (this is rumored to also take 2 SIM cards, with one supplanting the SD card, but I've yet to try).  Whatever you need from a phone, you can achieve on this hardware, and you'll be hard-pressed to find anything much better shy of the $500+ range.","images":[],"asin":"B01N6NTIRH","parent_asin":"B01N6NTIRH","user_id":"AF5KBDP4UGYHRARB6MUJHSCSHMUQ","timestamp":1499061089914,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":789,"phone_score":-0.8878560662,"battery_score":-0.8878560662,"screen_score":-0.8878560662,"camera_score":-0.8878560662,"price_score":-0.8878560662,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":-0.8878560662,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.8878560662,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.8878560662,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":-0.8878560662,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.8878560662,"wifi_score":-0.8878560662,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

Saw the Exalt II but didn't want to pay the premium for a few, albeit nice improvements. So found a source for the original Exalt. Still love this phone except that now I cannot get the clip-on armor casing I had for the first one as they discontinued it. Oh well. Still the phone I want.<br \/><br \/>edit: Aug 2018 - Last one I ordered and reviewed got wet from a large poolside splash. Put it into a bag of rice and no-go yet. Screen did dry though. May yet come back and if so I will keep it as a backup. Anyway the new phone arrived in 3 days and first thing that greeted me was a series of cards on the box informing me that Verizon was no longer activating CDMA phones as of June 2018. Another card listed a series of carriers which utilize Verizon older 3G network and would activate my phone. I still tried to activate it being an existing Verizon customer who had just lost a phone that was working fine on their network very recently. Tried online first but received standard message about CDMA phones not being supported anymore. So then I went on the web and found the only real answer to the issue. Do it on the phone using *288 and then following instructions.Worked like a charm and Verizon even backed up my data from the backup cloud. Only thing I lost was the pics since I wasn't using an SD card. Was so happy to get my new phone up and running I bought a TurtleBack leather case for it since I was always dropping my last phone which wasn't armored (see above).","images":[],"asin":"B00EN6D8H4","parent_asin":"B00EN6D8H4","user_id":"AG7JKYCWYNYXASLCKTVDEW7AKFNA","timestamp":1473683056000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":308,"phone_score":0.8060978651,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.8060978651,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.8060978651,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.8060978651,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.8060978651,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

The keyboard is more fluently to write and fast. Battery last forever. Stylus is responsive. Material are less heavy than the Note 9 but more sturdy than the Stylo 3 Plus.

But after spending an evening setting up apps and transferring data from my working iPhone 8 Plus I was very happy. Then the next day I started noticing that during calls the audio would drop out, then come back during phone calls not matter were I was located at my house. I even went as far as moving closer to a windows and even tried outside. No luck in resolving my problem. I then called Motorola and after asking them if they were experiencing problems  with the Z4's and was told no. I went thru the basics (reboot the phone. make sure its up to date, and killing all apps) they had me reset the network connection. Still no luck. I read many forum posts but nothing worked. I then ran across a a forum on Motorola's site that had pages and pages of people complaining about a combination of the Snapdragon Processor and a poorly designed antenna as a probable culprit. I responded back to a text message form Motorola that I'm still  experiencing problems and then responded to an email that my call was being closed. A day or so later I received a call from Motorola and informed them that I had already initiated an Amazon Return and order another brand of phone.<br \/><br \/>I honestly loved the phone, but I need a phone to make calls and the Moto Z4 didn't. I downloaded and app called Network Cell Info which display signal strength and location of the Verizon towers i was connected to. And this app showed towers disappearing and reappearing constantly which I am guessing is my problem.<br \/><br \/>I have concluded that its a combination of 2-3 bars signal and the Moto Z4's processor and antenna. If I lived in an area that was blanketed by cell towers and 5 bars I believe I would still own the Moto Z4 but because I do not I am returning the phone & case.

No compass. I don't know if this device doesn't have compass at all or it's not good enough, but for practical purposes there is no compass.

My situation is, when I took my Sim card out of the OUKITEL C 17 PRO and placed it in the OUKITEL WP 18 PRO it rebooted the phone into recovery mode, every attempt to boot up the phone resulted in the phone always going into recovery mode. I am still awaiting feedback from OUKITEL customer service.. it's going on 3 weeks, with approximately 5 emails to the OUKITEL company, with NO reply. I cannot in good faith, recommend this company. I however did get in touch with the seller HUACHEN-US, they were as helpful as could be, they did reply to my situations and tried to fix the problem.

This happens when using Google Maps regularly lately. The latest problem I am having is that the phone thinks that I am tapping on the touchscreen when I am not. Sometimes it stops thinking that and I can use the phone normally. Other times it is unusable. It is always the same spot on the phone, so it opens google search from my home screen and messes with me while I am trying to call or text. Since I am inside of the 1 year warranty period, I contacted BLU and will add information about their response to my review as it unfolds. I have bought a few BLU phones in the past and found that they were very good for their price. I don't think that they are quite up to Samsung or ASUS quality, but you can afford to replace them once in a while which is nice. They also have features that the other phones don't such as dual sim, external storage, etc.<br \/><br \/>Update - after 48 hours, no response to my email.<br \/>I found that there is a BLU support website. That worked much better. I had a pretty quick response and they will RMA the phone. I wouldn't have it for 2-3 weeks though, which would be tough. In the meantime, a new firmware update came out this week and it seems to have helped with some of the issues I was having with restarts, and the touchscreen hasn't glitched in a few days, so I am not going to return it at this time.","images":[],"asin":"B077NXNK2L","parent_asin":"B077NXNK2L","user_id":"AE7QI2EIOACNUZZVRE5V6TEKPJBQ","timestamp":1543330317949,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":298,"phone_score":-0.874581337,"battery_score":-0.874581337,"screen_score":-0.874581337,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":-0.874581337,"phones_score":-0.874581337,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.874581337,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":-0.874581337,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.874581337,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

But that's not so much the phone as it is the OS.  Best part ... I paired this with the $45 all-inclusive auto prepay plan at Verizon.  I get unlimited phone and text, and because I auto-pay, they double the data from 500mb to 1gb each month.  Because I do so much of my data over WiFi, I haven't come close to surpassing the 1gb in the three months that I've had the phone. One other thing to think about is tax. As a pre-pay plan, it's very low.  Never any BS charges, so I never pay more than $48 and change.  Lastly ... this replaced my crappy ATT service, so I get much better service as a result of the deal, too.  Overall, a major upgrade for less $$.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"good looking hardware, bad software and menus","text":"(...)<br \/>The good: its a very nice looking phone; its the right size, neither too small or too big; blue tooth enabled. The best is the blue tooth that allows you to use wireless headsets or connect to your PC and use the phone to send\/receive faxes, surf the net, or update the address book.<br \/>The bad: you cannot read the screen outside unless its dark (Its like trying to watch TV when the sun is hitting the screen directly.); the camera is a gimmick that fades away pretty quick (I never used it that much); the software is slow; and the menus are counter-intuitive.<br \/>The worst is the software and the menus. I havent seen a phone that has easier menus than Nokia and this Sony Ericsson is no exception. Nokia's menus are very intuitive and easy to use, this phone's menu is just badly designed, meaning that you have to push more buttons than necessary to perform common tasks like adding a number to your address book, or editing an address book entry, moving messages around, going back to the main menu, etc. Also, because the menus are software-based (vs. being hard wired into the chip like phones with monochrome screens) there is a lag sometimes between the instant you push a button and when the menu is displayed on the screen, like using a computer with little memory.  Also, you are not allowed to erase the built-in TMobile graphics and sounds, which take up memory space, and you cannot use a recording as your Ring Tone (they do that so that you dont use \"protected\" music for your ring tones and are thus forced to buy it from them). Finally, the phone actually crashes if you stop a voice record command immediately after starting it.<br \/>All in all, nice looking hardware but with crappily designed menus.","images":[],"asin":"B0000AGRYX","parent_asin":"B0000AGRYX","user_id":"AGKG2LFJ2HZE5AR4L7PKX6NUGZTA","timestamp":1081914813000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":309,"phone_score":0.8774966002,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.8774965405,"camera_score":0.8774966002,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.8774965405,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.8774966002,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.8774965405,"app_score":0.8774966002,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.8774966002}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fantastic Dumb Phone (6 stars!) works on Net10 perfectly","text":"UPDATE: I have had this phone for almost a year now. It has been dropped repeatedly including a 9 foot drop off a roof onto hard packed dirt. An extra note is that the screen is tempered glass and has NO scratches after a full 11 months of abuse. (There is a reason I wanted this type of phone ;-)<br \/><br \/>NOTE: I have been using this phone for two weeks and I am 100% satisfied. Photos were taken by this phone to show resolution and color accuracy.<br \/><br \/>NOTE I purchased this phone in March of 2020 and paid $79 for a refurbished phone, they are $150 new as I write this review.<br \/><br \/>I think this phone is ideal for rugged living outdoor people that don't care about \"apps\" and other smart phone silliness. Its great for builders, farmers and anyone else that plays and works hard on the edge.<br \/><br \/>If you want a tough dumb phone this is the ticket. Dropped it the day I got service on it. Bounced a foot off the asphalt. Yesterday it fell in mud, I unplugged the headset and closed the plastic flap on the headphone jack, and then (gently) sprayed it off with a garden hose. #&$^@% Awesome!<br \/><br \/>Includes calculator, timer, stopwatch, alarm, world clock , calendar, simple web browser (works for forecast.weather daht gov), FM radio (excellent long distance reception, requires wired headphones for antenna but can play mono through the loud speaker), speaker phone (very loud), flashlight, 5MP camera with 720P30F video camcorder (with decent picture and good white balance), audio recorder (can also record the FM radio), SMS and MMS texting.<br \/><br \/>This phone is full 4G-LTE and sounds better than my older LG smart phone (according to my friends). The speaker phone is very loud (you can turn it down) and you can play the radio through the speaker but you have to have a headphone plugged in as an antenna.<br \/><br \/>This phone connects to a computer as a regular USB storage device (umass) and offers full access to your SD card and access to the phones public storage. Verified works on Windows 7 and Linux -- no special software needed.<br \/><br \/>There are no apps and no GPS but it does appear to talk on the network when you are not actually using it so I assume it can still track you somehow but what I really wanted was a tough phone and the ability to say: \"Sorry, I have a real phone and it won't run you silly app\" the next time I ask for help at a brick and mortar and they tell me they have a *%# app.<br \/><br \/>The only hiccup I had with this phone was getting the data working, you don't have that problem if you are reading this review, I already figured it out and wrote some instructions:<br \/><br \/>GETTING DATA SERVICE TO WORK:<br \/><br \/>Note, depending on your carrier you will need to contact them to get the \"APN\" configuration that they use and then you will need to manually enter this info into the phone. Try searching on their website for \"apn configuration\" if you cant contact them by phone.<br \/><br \/>You need to already have phone service, then you configure APN. You use the APN information from YOUR carrier (they will need your SIM# or phone number). For example,  Net10 has a site at net10 dot com slash apn, enter your sim or phone number and they will return a page with the APN info you need to put into your phone<br \/><br \/>Here is how to put this APN information into the  SONIM XP 5700 phone:<br \/><br \/>1. click: System Settings (from application screen or the menu button (top left on keypad)<br \/><br \/>2. click: More...  (this is a menu item in system settings)<br \/><br \/>3. click: Mobile Networks (scroll down)<br \/><br \/>4. click: Access Point Names (APN)<br \/><br \/>5. [Press the menu button, top left on the keypad]<br \/><br \/>6. click: New APN<br \/><br \/>7. Enter the information from [YOUR CARRIER] in the appropriate text box on the phone.<br \/><br \/>*** DO NOT ENTER any other information than what the carrier gives you.<br \/><br \/>8. [Press the menu button, top left on the keypad]<br \/><br \/>9. click: Save<br \/><br \/>10.

You're better off getting a phone through a carrier like T-Mobile etc and paying more money unfortunately, but the up-side to it is big carriers will treat you \"the customer\" better even if you don't opt in for insurance as long as you're within the 1 yr warranty period and there is no water or physical damage, Blu won't. This is the 1rst Blu phone I purchased through amazon. The phone specs are appealing but that's where it ends. This phone from day 1 constantly freezes even with all the updates which weren't many.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Works flawlessly on T-Mobile!","text":"I bought 2 of these when my daughter and I switched from AT&T to T-Mobile to cut our plan cost in half. I had previously had a Blu R1 HD and it worked flawlessly with AT&T. So since AT&T and T-Mobile networks are similar, I figured the BLU R2 LTE would be a good choice for the switch. I was right! We walked into a local T-Mobile store with these phones and a 64 gigabyte micro sd card for each. The store personnel had no problem with us using these phones. The setup was easy and we walked out about 20 minutes later with both phones operating with our original phone numbers on the T-Mobile network. We did purchase the T-Mobile sim card in the store, but other than that there were no surprises.<br \/><br \/>It's been 3 months now and we're still extremely pleased with these phones. The battery life is great. The picture quality from both front and rear cameras is awesome. We chose to add a 64 gigabyte sd card because we both take lots of pictures, and with both cameras being 13 megapixels, we didn't want to have to worry about running out of space. So far, neither one of us have run into any apps that don't function properly.<br \/><br \/>At this point, I wouldn't hesitate purchasing these again and recommending them to friends and family!","images":[],"asin":"B0741H4SBY","parent_asin":"B0741H4SBY","user_id":"AFOQV4KDB4GLGAJFVWETC747P3MA","timestamp":1524972730941,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":231,"phone_score":0.9042193294,"battery_score":0.9042192101,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.9042193294,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.9042192101,"life_score":0.9042193294,"quality_score":0.9042192101,"apps_score":0.9042193294,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.9042192101,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.9042193294,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9042192101,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

We used straight talk as the carrier and it works just fine. It came with 2 batteries, Charger, head phones\/ear piece, screen protector, and a flip cover case. Now that's what you call a deal! I would defiantly recommend this product.","images":[],"asin":"B0090AAOUW","parent_asin":"B0090AAOUW","user_id":"AEXX6ZXYW6HP6FCITLYXVUAUGBNQ","timestamp":1378601632000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":139,"phone_score":0.7666803002,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.7666803598,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.7666803002,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.7666803598,"features_score":0.7666803002,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.7666803598}

It is a ruggedized phone with an oversized battery after all, and the specs aren't great by modern standards.<br \/><br \/>It's actually a lot more svelte than it looks.  It's slightly thinner than my old Galaxy S10+ in a case.  The screen protector that came with it is good enough that I still haven't put on the tempered glass ones I ordered.  It can definitely handle missing my pouch and bouncing down a flight of concrete stairs as well.<br \/><br \/>Regarding performance;  It's actually better than expected.  Not overwhelmingly so, but it can do reasonably well playing Golf Rival or War Robots, and is just fine for the majority of work apps.<br \/><br \/>The closest thing I have to a complaint is onboard storage, can't expand it when using dual SIMs, and I filled it up.

Use my landline for phone calls. Most I do is texts couple friends a day to just check on them, or do a Google search. I wasted my money. Will be looking for a new phone.<br \/><br \/>I'm updating my previous review I made I November, 2022. I have had more problems with this phone than the Samsungs I had in the past. They lasted years. I bought this one because of the price and internal memory.  Will never buy another Moto phone again.<br \/><br \/>Bought this phone to replace a Samsung. Very happy with the price, having 128 GB.<br \/>I'm not real tech savvy, but watched a video on google, and it helped a lot.  Only thing I am not happy with is the gifs in the text messaging. Once I send them, gifs are blurry. Ones I receive from others are clear. Can't seem to get help to fix problem.  Contacted phone provider. They said just have to live with the Message app on phone. Some gifs are ok. Majority are blurry, so guess won't be sending many to my friends anymore.  Camera takes great photos. Love setting to take photo if lighting is dark.  It is only a little taller than my Samsung, but still fits in my small purse. And fit perfect in the wallet case I bought. So, happy so far.

However, the sellers falsely advertise the components of this product by indicating that it comes with a clear case. The picture listed with this product implies that the case sent is completely clear however these cases come with weird designs on them. When I contacted the seller regarding this issue and asking if they would allow me to exchange them for clear cases I was just told that this phone comes with assorted cases. If I saw that in the description, picture, or title I wouldn't complain. Also, in the reviews, people had clear cases! I don't understand why I received multiple phones without this clear case. I did not see that in the description and they offered me no help at all. I would go to a different seller and that is what I plan on doing when purchasing more of these. If there is a bigger problem with your phone they probably won't help you out.

Like many other people, mine is very slow and loaded with garbage programs that can't be uninstalled, meaning that you NEED to buy an SD card if you want to do anything other than calling and\/or texting.  It sounds like I was lucky, because mine was unlocked, making the fact that it's loaded with a bunch of AT&T crap even more irritating (I use Tracfone).  It's good for simple calling and texting, but any \"smart\" functions don't work on mine- I have to be connected to wifi, even though I bought a data plan.  But that might not be a problem with the phone, that might be a problem with my carrier.

The very mixed, sometimes extreme, reviews of the 650 and the relatively high price for an unlocked Treo kept me away. With the release of the next generation of Treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 I decided to take a chance. After a week of fairly active use I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my new Treo. I bought my new unlocked (Cingular branded) Treo online. The phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that I have owned. I have not had any dropped calls. The browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my Treo work well. I live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still GPRS\/EDGE, so my Tro 650 is just right. I easily synced my Treo with my MacBook with no problems. Over all for $225 + shipping and handling of $20 I have to say that this was a real bargain.","images":[],"asin":"B000982UY2","parent_asin":"B000982UY2","user_id":"AESKFWKZEWAZC7ZZTK6NV7ZO5ICQ","timestamp":1167684191000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":185,"phone_score":0.8892796636,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.8892796636,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.8892796636,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

The Blu Studio 5.3 II offered the best specs for the price (outside of buying direct from China) . I am primarily a business user - not much gamimg at all.  After 3 months of use, overall, I am very happy with this phone, with just a couple issues that keep it from being 5 star.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>* Large clear screen, and no scratches with regular use<br \/>* loud enough phone.<br \/>* Strong WiFi + easy to connect to a variety of sources, yet seems to use very little power when out of range but scanning for a signal<br \/>* snappy performance<br \/>* have only had to do a hard reset once, although I do shut it off every night to clear stray tasks<br \/>* 1gb storage + 32 GB SD addn gives me plenty of space for apps<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>* 512 ram is kind of all for android 4.1. I occasionally get low memory warnings, which is kind of a pain.<br \/>* I wish volume & screen brightness settings had more gradations, especially on the low\/dark side. Lowest setting is too loud\/bright for me.<br \/>* As other reviewers have noticed, the screen will go dim after just a few seconds of idle. I assumed this was an android power feature. When reading or typing I have to touch the screen frequently to keep it bright.<br \/>* Tough to fimd a good case. I bought a Note II generic case. Phone fit ok, but case is alrwady wearing out.<br \/><br \/>My only other comment is simply a curious observation. Less than a week after getting my phone I bruised the screen pretty badly. After another week of use the bruise went from the size of a nickel to a large, elongated thumbprint! I was very disappointed, bit figured it was my own fault. I had to go out to a camp for a week, so while gone I took the battery out and let the phone sit without power.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Excellent value overall","text":"Disregarding the fact that most smartphones these days are way overpriced, the OnePlus 7 Pro is an excellent value for its price compared to the competition. The 7 Pro appears to have been discontinued sometime in late 2019. There's a MacLaren version that costs several hundred dollars more that offers 5G and a fancier case, but I didn't care for the phone color or the premium price. The 7 Pro offers nearly pure Android 10 with a minimal Oxygen OS by One Plus. With 256 GB storage, 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 855, 90 Hz refresh rate, three lenses, no notch, motorized pop-up selfie camera, and other features, this is more of a computer or small tablet than a phone. It's nearly identical in size to the Samsung Note 10+.<br \/><br \/>I only have a couple of quibbles that keep me from giving it 5 stars. If Amazon allowed, I'd give it a rating of 4.8 stars. One quibble is that the camera lacks a picture ration of 16:9, which fills the typical computer monitor screen. At present, it only offers 4:3 or 20:9, which will have black bars on top and bottom when displayed on your desktop or laptop. This can be compensated for by downloading a third-party camera app that offers the 16:9 ratio, which I did for now, until I see if they offer a software update to correct this feature. Another is that, lacking an LED notification, it's supposed to have horizon lights, long lights along the curved left & right edges, but they're not working in my sample. Many others online also confirm that theirs are not working either. One more omission is the converter for a standard earphone plug to the C-type USB connector. I had to order that separately from OnePlus.<br \/><br \/>The packaging of the product is the best I've seen for almost any product. It's almost like you bought a fancy piece of jewelry from Tiffany's. Included is a very nice quality slim clear plastic cover to provide non-slip grip and protection for the phone, and the screen comes protected with a perfectly factory-installed screen protector that's nearly indistinguishable from the glass. You can only tell it's there by looking or feeling closely along the edges of the screen.<br \/><br \/>Overall, it's probably the best and most powerful large-screen smartphone for the money. Fast, clean, smooth, and powerful. Presumably, a new model is coming out soon, probably the OnePlus 8. When it does come out, you may be able to find the 7 Pro at an even lower price.","images":[],"asin":"B07RCGY3VD","parent_asin":"B07RCGY3VD","user_id":"AHCBHNYHNZAMYRKQCFCHWE5EZMPQ","timestamp":1581447878081,"helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":426,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Edited review.","text":"While I originally gave this product a 1 star review, I'm changing it to a 5 star review, because when the company learned of my issues with the phone, they were quick to offer a solution to my problem. I have to add that I did not contact them, they contacted me to see what they could do to rectify the issue. While I was not able to get my phones connected to a carrier in the USA, the phone itself is a great phone and the price is unbeatable. They seem absolutely sturdy and durable, even after several drops by my kids, the phones remain pristine in appearance. I wish I could have gotten service for them because they are great, especially if you're tough on phones.<br \/><br \/>Purchased these phones as Christmas gifts for my children 12 and 10, as I refuse to spend close to a grand on phones for kids, the price was right. However, they've been an absolute nightmare. They are not compatible with any cell phone carriers in the USA. I've spent more money on sim cards than I did on the phones and none of them work. Overpriced paper weights is what they are. Unfortunately my son accidentally threw away his box so I can't even return them both.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"This phone's battery will last WEEKS for a light user, and has good service","text":"I mostly use my phone to surf the web occasionally throughout the day and send text messages. This phone essentially doesn't need to be charged. I only connect it to the charger, maybe once every couple weeks and it doesn't even get to full charge, but that's how ridiculously huge this battery is. There are laptops with smaller batteries than this phone. It literally takes over 15 hours to fully charge this thing from zero with a low-wattage charger, but it also supports 18W charging. It doesn't matter though because this thing will go several days on a 20% charge for me.<br \/><br \/>I had the WP5 before, which was a fine phone, but doesn't pick up a bunch of the cellular channel for T-mobile, so service was awful.<br \/><br \/>This phone does not have that issue. It picks up more 4G channels than many phones you get in the USA. It picks up one 5G channel, which is the most common 5G cannel and works fine if you have coverage. My city doesn't have great 5G coverage, so I just turn that feature off, since it doesn't reliably receive phone calls and text messages if it's constant switching networks. This is not really an issue with the phone.<br \/><br \/>The WP5 had a charger port cover that was extremely difficult for me to remove without using a paper clip or something. This phone has an easier to remove cover for charging, not that you'd need to use it much!<br \/><br \/>This phone is HUGE. Like 4x bigger than a normal phone, and the screen isn't any bigger. So if you want this phone, keep that in mind. It will strain your hand to use it for a long time, but that's the price we pay for the 15000mAh battery. The WP5 was way bigger than other phones, but this phone is like twice as big as that one. I'm pretty sure you could literally crush an iPhone or Samsung phone using this phone as a hammer and it would still work afterward.","images":[],"asin":"B09FFF2RWM","parent_asin":"B09FFF2RWM","user_id":"AF42W3MPZVWTVUBVQNQCCNBEI3JA","timestamp":1663782785236,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":343,"phone_score":0.7476841807,"battery_score":0.7476841807,"screen_score":0.7476841807,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.7476841807,"phones_score":0.7476841807,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.7476841807,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.7476841807,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.7476841807,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A phone with good build quality\/display\/utilities,decent battery\/connectivity, average camera and confusing speaker volume","text":"I bought this phone as a standby phone when my Samsung Galaxy S8 had an issue. The build quality of the phone is excellent with a metal body design. Other than NFC it has almost everything that is expected in a smartphone. The display is good and clear and did not observe any issues in bright sunlight. The 4000+ battery with heavy use will last close to 1.5 days. The phone get fully charged from 0% to 100% in 3 hours or less. Bluetooth initially did not find any devices, however after a restart everything was good.The phone may confuse many users who switch from iPhone\/Samsung\/Motorola\/LG which show LTE for LTE connection. This phone show it as 4G for an LTE connection. This phone has an FM radio, Calculator, currency converter, Unit converter and application lock as part of phone UI.  The easy mode and kids mode in phone will be useful while giving phone to seniors or kids. The audio recording option in call is also a good feature of this phone. In short, this phone has everything that one may look for. The camera of the phone is good in bright light, however do not expect it to be equally good in low light photography.<br \/><br \/>Now to the downside. As a phone if you are using near your ear or with a head phone or with a Bluetooth headphone everything will be fine. However, if you are in a conference room and put the phone in speakers not everyone may understand what others are saying in call. The same applicable for others as well. If you put the phone in speaker mode while driving, then it is a disaster. You will not understand anything the other person is saying in call. I am still trying to find an option to resolve this major issue. In short the speaker is just average. It is loud, however the quality of sound is just average. This phone is yet to get an upgrade to Android O. Also, surprisingly this phone does not come with an ordinary earphone in the original box.<br \/><br \/>Overall, the phone is good for its price.<br \/><br \/>Update on 9\/2:<br \/><br \/>After more than a month of use the following is my experience. I use phone a lot. I did not experience any call drop due to phone issues. Connection to Bluetooth headset  has issues at times. It drop connection back to phone while talking. Battery will last more than a day, however it will not be enough to cover the second day. Camera is more like a hit or miss. Daylight photos are 70% success. Low light photography has only 20% success. At times, the camera app  crash or freeze. Speaker volume is good and loud for watching videos and music. However, for call it is unusually weak and I don't know why it is so. The phone will need close to 3 hours for full charge. However, initial 50% charging can be achieved by around 40 min of charging. As we get closer to full charge it slow down charging. That is my observation. The phone did not show any slowness. It still has Android 7 with latest security patch. Also, received an update to Zen UI. No issue observed with GPS. Occasionally, it get warm while using GPS. The phone does not get warm in long hours of call or internet usage.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41bHRXQFSkL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41bHRXQFSkL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41bHRXQFSkL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B079142R7Y","parent_asin":"B079142R7Y","user_id":"AGEHR3WCKCMJ56XWEDCFS3STO4DQ","timestamp":1532488877112,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":569,"phone_score":0.841771245,"battery_score":0.841771245,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.841771245,"price_score":0.841771245,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.841771245,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.841771245,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.841771245,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.841771245,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Elegance, innovation, and design at a $150 price tag.","text":"The Sharp Aquos Crystal is an experiment in elegance, innovation, sleek design, and compromise, all at an affordable price tag.<br \/><br \/>Design: It is a flat front, with simply no bezels around the screen, save for the large chin. The glass simply melts along the edges of the device. The lack of a bezel gives it a frankly eye-catching amount of dazzle that few phones succeed to do. All around the device is a pseudo-metal band that makes it feel a bit more high-quality than it seems, which is impressive. The back is rounded like a Moto X or Moto G, but the battery cover is a somewhat grid-dotted form, one which helps the grip of the phone... Something that can help a bit.<br \/><br \/>Hardware: Specs are simple. Quad-core 1.2GHz processor, Adreno 305 graphics, 1.5GB RAM, 8GB storage, nano-SIM slot, microSD expansion, non-removable 2040mAh battery, and a TFT capacitive 720p display. Capacitive is a touch-screen standard by now, but I'm not sure about the TFT bit. Look at the screen closely, and you might see the reflections of a series of dots, forming a grid system on the display. I'm not familiar with touch-screen technology, but I will say a visible grid on a smartphone sounds like we walked 10 years back to Palms. This isn't helped by the 5 inch, phablet-like size of the device. It is basically the size of the iPhone 6, albeit with more pixels per inch, and it is a bit clumsy to one-hand. Thank that metal band.<br \/><br \/>You're also dealing with an 8MP shooter of a camera, with a 1.2MP selfie-cam, both of which are incredible to view through the screen. The front facing camera sits at the bottom of the phone, asking you to hold it upside down to avoid a strange camera angle.<br \/><br \/>Holding it upside down reminds you... Where's the earpiece? How do you talk? Simple. Direct Wave Receiver. Akin to Google Glass and the bone conduction, DWR simply transmits sound waves through the air, into and around your ear. The upside? You can hold the phone anywhere near the ear and you can hear the person. Downside? You can't hear them much anyway. It's not exactly loud.<br \/><br \/>Top it off with a simple rainbow notification light, and you have some surprising hardware.<br \/><br \/>Software: Inside the ROM, a near-stock version of Android 4.4.2 sits in, given a few resources to cater to Sprint and Sharp hardware. All the Google apps are installed, stock phone, messaging, music, video, gallery and the like are included. Beyond that, there's an Assistant app to replace Google Search, however you can still install Google Search if you don't want it. There's a Clip Now feature that basically makes screenshotting your phone as simple as a swipe gesture away. OfficeSuite is available on the device, and Sprint\/Boost offers some type of video voicemail that is available. I haven't seen anything about that on Ting, and I don't think I care.<br \/><br \/>The device offers Harman\/Kardon Clari-Fi to improve Bluetooth\/headset sound quality. I've yet to test this, but I imagine it isn't impressive. The display also lends itself to \"frameless effects,\" an effect that applies graphics along all sides when certain actions occur, in order to complement the edge-to-edge display.<br \/><br \/>As for the Sprint-centric element, we have Mobile ID, that video voicemail, and \"Connections Optimizer,\" a tool that attempts to ensure even and strong signals to Sprint towers and your trusted wireless networks to ensure even voice and data access that maximizes speeds and performance. Unfortunately, I saw it prioritize 3G when I had a 4GLTE signal in my area. I turned this off and ignored it since.<br \/><br \/>Performance: Incredible. The OS and most software don't lag much, if at all. It's a smooth experience almost through it all. Gaming is a cinch, video is immersive to a new level with no bezels, and reading is fantastic. Having previously owned the Samsung Galaxy S III, I don't regret purchasing this one. And for the $50 difference between it and this on Amazon, there's no question. You buy this one, unless you aren't doing anything related to Sprint. In which case, sorry, it's a bit CDMA only. Don't understand? Look it up.<br \/><br \/>Final testament: Sharp has made an impressive product, and it all holds the elements of a good phone. The specs don't put it up with the latest and greatest phones, but for a great and beautiful product with an experience that is barely compromised, it is worth every cent.","images":[],"asin":"B00O15E3MQ","parent_asin":"B00O15E3MQ","user_id":"AHGEO2F5PUH6WDCYR65Z3IBOXX3Q","timestamp":1418263498000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":760,"phone_score":0.9793738127,"battery_score":0.9793738127,"screen_score":0.9793738127,"camera_score":0.9793738127,"price_score":0.9793738127,"phones_score":0.9793738127,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.9793738127,"apps_score":0.9793738127,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.9793738127,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.9793738127,"device_score":0.9793738127,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9793738127,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.9793738127}

Battery life sucks (I mean big time) A few minutes of play will take the battery down a bar. Seriously.<br \/>2. I live in a strange place between two mountains where in this rare instance ATT is better then Verizon. I had to buy a booster box to enhance the signal.

I haven't totally figured this out yet but it is far less intuitive then say the Palm Pre. You cannot set the ringtone from editing the user. It should let you browse to any ringtone, but it only brings up the ones that came with the phone.<br \/>4. No Swype? Not sure why not..I tried installing it, no success.<br \/>5.

The only way it boots up all the way with no problems is to leave the phone's back panel\/cover off. When I clip the back panel back on and I hear the snap\/click sound, the phone reboots and goes right back to the continuous boot cycle (on the screen it shows &#34;BLU Bold Like Us; Powered by Android,&#34; screen goes  Black then shows &#34;BLU Bold Like Us; Powered by Android&#34; again...does this continuously, until I take the back panel off again).

{"rating":5.0,"title":"i730, an Improvement over the i700.","text":"Deciding on the best phone\/PDA for you will depend on your lifestyle.<br \/><br \/>I am an author, publisher and speaker; I speak all over the world and fly more than 4,000 miles each week. I do not check bags and do not have room for paper books. I spend a lot of time on airplanes and sequestered on the other side of Security waiting in airports. I get to read a lot of electronic books (eBooks).<br \/><br \/>In other words, your mileage (lifestyle) may vary.<br \/><br \/>If you stay at home, get the paper book (pBook).<br \/><br \/>If you spend a lot of time driving, get an audio edition (aBook).<br \/><br \/>For me, being able to read eBooks is a major consideration.<br \/><br \/>The i700 came with MS-Reader; the i730 does not. Probably because Samsung\/Verizon realize reading is not as good on the smaller screen. You have to download the Reader from Microsoft--no charge.<br \/><br \/>On the i700, the text block on the screen measures 1 5\/8 x 1 3\/4; on the i730, it is 1 3\/8 x 1 3\/8 with very wide margins. In other words, much of the (smaller) screen is not even used for text.<br \/><br \/>The i700 is a bit better for reading books but that model does not have WiFi or Bluetooth.<br \/><br \/>To advance eBook pages in MS-Reader, you press the side or the bottom of the large button. However it is too easy to press the reverse button at the same time; then i730 exits the Reader.<br \/><br \/>Audio books play well on the i730. Get a one- or two- gig storage card; audio takes up a lot of space.<br \/><br \/>One storage card challenge has been solved on the i730. On the i700, you could touch the card unconsciously and it would spring and fly across the room. That could be an expensive loss. The i730 holds onto the card when you release it; you have to pull it out of the unit.<br \/><br \/>Size of the i730 is about the same as the Palm but a bit thicker and heavier. The Samsung SCH-i730 weighs 6.8 ounces with the slim battery and measures 4.4 (5.2 including the antenna) x 2.25 x .9 (with the slim battery) inches.<br \/><br \/>I purchased the i730 for its additional capabilities: mostly WiFi. WiFi can be turned off to reduce power consumption.<br \/><br \/>Bluetooth initiation was quite easy. I use the i730 with the JABRA FreeSpeak 250 headset.<br \/><br \/>I am use to the peck-peck keyboard so I do not use the thumb-board very much. Since the screen is smaller, the keyboard is very small. It is a greater challenge to touch on the right squares. You can enlarge the \"buttons\" (squares) but then you lose the numbers.<br \/><br \/>Text messaging is much better than on a phone. You can use the keyboard or thumb board. When I fly in to deliver a speech, I text message the meeting planner on landing. That tells him or her that I am in town; a text message does not cause an interruption like a cell phone call.<br \/><br \/>EVDO coverage has expanded to more cities. See<br \/><br \/>http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/feature\/-\/571610\/103-9341655-9959826<br \/><br \/>I have not been able to get my desktop computer to talk to my notebook computer on the network. So I use the i730 to update the notebook Calendar and address book. Just sync with the desktop and sync with the notebook from time to time.<br \/><br \/>The i730 I rec'd came with both the slim and pregnant batteries. I bought a carrying case online. The i730 is slimmer than the i700 so the belt case is slimmer-and more comfortable to wear.<br \/><br \/>The i730 does not have a camera.<br \/><br \/>On trips to Canada, I've found the Verizon phone works, WiFi works, text messaging works and message retrieval works but the i730 (like the i700) will not retrieve email or surf the web.<br \/><br \/>I've had a Samsung i700 with Verizon for two years. I understand the Pocket PC. Like the i700, I spent a lot of time on the phone to Verizon i730 Support to set up the i730.<br \/><br \/>Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com","images":[],"asin":"B000A6TRRG","parent_asin":"B000A6TRRG","user_id":"AEFAGOGCUVDVX43GIIENFQ4KL3WA","timestamp":1124148882000,"helpful_vote":18,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":695,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Great phone. Don't expect to get your amazon rebate money.","text":"[...]<br \/><br \/>Ok, so I've always known rebates often turn out to be a scam, but is that really the best they could do? Right before they tell me I didn't indicate the product on the form (which I did, have a copy right here), they specifically state what product I purchased!<br \/><br \/>Talk about insulting.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, back to the phone. The bluetooth feature is nice, though I leave it off most of the time because I'm concerned with bluetooth security issues. It does work well with my BlueTrek G2 headset, though the battery life of the phone is severely reduced even just having it on, not talking on it. The phone syncs great with my Apple PowerBook and the bluetooth adapter, which made it a breeze to get all my phone numbers added to the phone.<br \/><br \/>As expected, the picture quality from the camera isn't great, but I've found it is good enough for taking pictures to use as wallpaper on the phone. If I want to take pictures, I'll use a regular digital camera anyway.<br \/><br \/>The address book is decent, though I found some features missing that my previous Nextel (Motorola) phone had. Namely, you can't add enough numbers for people in the phone. I'm probably one of the few people to have this problem, but I have dozens of contacts for whom I need to have their home\/work\/cell phones and  pager in my phone. This comes close with home\/work\/cell but no pager.<br \/><br \/>The organizer is ok, but lacks a few things. It has an alarm feature which is quite loud, and can be set to recur. There is a way to have calendar entries change your profile, which is nice for automatically changing it to silent when your meeting starts. It doesn't appear to support recurring calendar events. I haven't tried syncing it with my work calendar yet to see how it deals with recurring events there, so I have hope it'll work ok.<br \/><br \/>Text messages: I get paged for a living, as I'm a Unix admin with an oncall rotation. This means I'm quite familiar with a number of electronic leashes. This is the worst phone I've had yet for text messages. This thing makes a short noise when you receive a message and then remains silent afterwords. Worthless! My last two phones and my oncall phone at work continually sound until you press a button to silence it, which is a must if it is to have a chance at waking me up if it's been a bad night. Near as I can tell, there's just no way of improving this part of the phone. My plain pager for work isn't perfect either, but it at least beeps for a minute before quieting down to one chirp a minute.<br \/><br \/>Call list: It has one, but I'm not thrilled with it. It does distinguish between incoming, outgoing, and missed calls. However, it seems to collapse multiple calls together sometimes. I say sometimes, because it appears to be only with missed calls, but I'm not certain. I think it just collapses the missed calls down if there are multiples in a short amount of time. Bottom line is, I'd like to see at what time each call was missed, not whichever one (earliest or latest, not sure) it chooses.<br \/><br \/>Overall: Great battery life (unless I'm using bluetooth!), good sound quality, great form factor, seems durable (the vibrate\/silent has vibrated it's way off the table a few times!). All in all a great phone, [...], still a great price for the phone.","images":[],"asin":"B0000AGRYX","parent_asin":"B0000AGRYX","user_id":"AFIWUP2MDGN5NCQYAARBCBI2U4GQ","timestamp":1103598086000,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":601,"phone_score":-0.597207129,"battery_score":-0.597207129,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":-0.597207129,"price_score":-0.597207129,"phones_score":-0.597207129,"life_score":-0.597207129,"quality_score":-0.597207129,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.597207129,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":-0.597207129,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.597207129,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":-0.597207129,"size_score":0.0}

If you are  relying on a cell phone for your primary phone you understand why this is problem. This started happening outside of Amazon's 30 day return policy (about 45 days after purchase), so I had to contact Motorola. If you cannot be without a phone for the time it takes to return yours and receive your \"like new\" replacement, for $24.99 they will send a \"like new phone\" and place an extra $200 hold on your credit card (you will also be charged tax for the full $224.99 which I'm guessing won't be refunded). This for a problem that they know exists. If you buy this phone (don't) make sure that you keep an eye out for any problems within the 1st 30 days and return it immediately for a full refund from Amazon.  You would be better off not buying this phone.<br \/><br \/>Update. The phone updated to android 10 and that fixed the issues with the phone turning itself off.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"This phone is heavy and huge, and a great buy","text":"I bought this phone as a GPS and Wifi device mostly for my motorcycle, so my review doesn't cover cell phone and carrier specific items.<br \/><br \/>I think many people that look at this phone might also be looking at the Armor X series for a rugged phone, and I had both the WP5 and an Armor X7 and did a comparison.  Spoiler, the WP5 won.<br \/><br \/>I set it up both and ran them side by side for battery, photos, GPS, and overall usage. The WP5 won hands down, and I don't think it was close. Side by side photos were the biggest difference. I wanted a GPS dashboard phone that could take better than decent photos without getting my iPhone out at every stop. The Armor X7 photos were junk. Both inside, outdoors and in low light. The WP5 is not an iPhone for sure, but it was markedly better in all conditions and at least 80-85% as good as the iPhone8. Next, overall Android operating system response also went to the WP5. Both right out of the box had Android 10 and very little bloat which is nice, but the WP5 felt smoother and faster than the X7. The X7 felt sluggish even at times and took longer to execute the same operations. Uploading photos to GPhotos for example to compare on the PC was really slow. The camera alone was enough for me to drop the X7, but add in the sluggish performance and it was a no brainer.<br \/><br \/>Battery life is crazy good (compared to iPhones). Went 5 days with 0 charging. I decided today to charge at 10% left, so probably could have finished out the 6th day. That included GPS screen on usage for a bunch of trail riding, downloading all the maps and apps to get started, playing around on it, and taking a few photos. Charge time from 10% to 100% was almost exactly 4 hours @ 2.0 A. The downside is this thing is huge!  Photos attached show it next to the X7.  We've taken to calling it the \"lead brick\" around my house.  It's definitely rugged and feels that way.  Raised edges on the screen side mean you can use it without a case and set it face down on a table without worrying.<br \/><br \/>GPS seemed to be spot on as well. I did a 1 K walk around with both the WP5 and iPhone8 side by side and the tracks are really close. I also mapped both my rides on routes I've ridden before so I could see the track differences. Tracked in Avenza Maps for both. The WP5 overlaps the other tracks from May and June on the same trail very well.  Also compared to my Fitbit Ionic GPS, and it was matching my Strava tracks for the same route too. If there is an issue with GPS on the phone, mine did not experience it. I'm very comfortable using it for GPS duty in the future.<br \/><br \/>Brightness was good. Still visible in outside direct sun. It's not as good as the iPhone, but better than the Armor X7 for sure. No concerns using it and seeing while riding down the county roads to the trail heads.<br \/><br \/>If I was carrying it around in my hand all day, it might get tiring.  But it's truly a 5 day battery life kinda phone even with a lot of usage.  I was worried it was too big at first and thought the X7 was a better fit, but the other pros outweight the weight and size con significantly.<br \/><br \/>I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for big battery life and a smooth Android experience in a very rugged package.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81ReG5CbQrL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81ReG5CbQrL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81ReG5CbQrL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81pNTOIiViL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81pNTOIiViL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81pNTOIiViL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91IA3cLskdL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91IA3cLskdL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/91IA3cLskdL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B0871HD5NT","parent_asin":"B0871HD5NT","user_id":"AF5IC6KJASIBVYF5JQ4VYA5UWWRA","timestamp":1605303235932,"helpful_vote":25,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":627,"phone_score":0.6105048656,"battery_score":0.6105048656,"screen_score":0.6105048656,"camera_score":0.6105048656,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.6105048656,"life_score":0.6105048656,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.6105048656,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.6105048656,"case_score":0.6105048656,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.6105048656,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.6105048656,"wifi_score":0.6105048656,"cell_score":0.610504806,"size_score":0.610504806}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"HP 6945 Phone (Unlocked)","text":"I don't like this Pocket PC.  Everything works, but its so slow... I allways close unnecesary opened applications, but it still slow.  It seems to me that HP have to work on using a new processor, something about double the actual speed of 416 Mhz.  Here are some observations:<br \/><br \/>1. The phone works, just put your SIM card and use it, thats ok.  The problem is that the software and response time never compares with my previous Sony Ericsson phones, my last one was a W600i.  You need both hands to operate it, if you are driving... looking for a phone number in contacts, Call History or the Speed Dial, be careful, use your Pocket PC phone can easily kill you... of course you can use a voice activation software that in my case, Latin America, almost none of the automatic softwares works (accent I guess). If I'm dialing a number and the voice mail alert starts playing right before the recorder starts... it doesn't matter if you press the End button, buttons are so slow in response that you have no time to place a miss call...<br \/><br \/>2. The GPS works just fine, but not with the HP applications... there are no maps for my country (Panama)I used the GPS Tuner software and had to georeference some images from google earth.<br \/><br \/>3. The HP 6945 freezes a lot, it is very anoying having to restard so often.  Some times it freezes when I'm receiving a call.<br \/><br \/>4. The square screen is not good because some of my applications don't work on it.<br \/><br \/>5. The camera is really slow to start, very limited functionality and bad quality photos... if you want to waste good moments... just go and take pictures with this mediocre camera.<br \/><br \/>6. The battery is very bad, you better keep on syncronizing very often or you'll end up with out batteries very soon.  There a lot of excuses like don't use your Blue tooth to often, dont use your GPS because it'll suck your battery, pay 55$ for a new bulky battery, stuf like that.<br \/><br \/>7. I'm not planning to buy other HP Pocket PC in the future, I'm so frustrated with this one.","images":[],"asin":"B000ILDSLO","parent_asin":"B000ILDSLO","user_id":"AE4ZRYKXSJ6O2ITBX7QLOXRAMZMA","timestamp":1174196693000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":374,"phone_score":-0.8489466906,"battery_score":-0.8489468098,"screen_score":-0.8489466906,"camera_score":-0.8489468098,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.8489466906,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.8489468098,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.8489468098,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.8489466906,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I love the gold tone look and feel and performance of this phone. It has a fast Snapdragon processor and has an excellent battery life at 5000mAh. The longest battery life in any phone. The screen size and image quality are perfect for my every day use. I couldn't be more happier with this phone since I've always wanted to own a Motorola brand phone for several years and only owned Samsung and LG in the past. One negligible difference for me is the missing \"Shake for flashlight\" feature. I guess this model for international use has that feature deactivated for some reason. It does have a high luminescent flash light which I don't use very often, but I'm glad to know it's there when I need it. Overall, I give this Moto e5 Plus a 5 Star rating for quality, looks, and performance.

I loved the G4 and this G5 is even better. I love going to camera mode with the twist  of my wrist and flashlight mode with a hatchet chop. To me, the Amazon ads are non-intrusive and are well worth the $60 saving. Google transferred my apps as soon as I logged onto Google and I just moved the SD card from the G4 to the G5 to move photos and music. I did have a hassle with the nano SIM and the micro SD cards as the directions were far from clear, but a video on YouTube got me straight.  I love the fingerprint reader as a touch of my right or left forefinger unlocks my phone which is so much easier than entering my pin number on the G4.

It just was not the same as new and it should have been, else BLU should have replaced it with a certified refurb if BLU actually preformed the diagnostics and if a it failed.  The WIFI and Bluetooth connections were usually flaky and unreliable.  I had similar problems with a BLU R1 HD.<br \/><br \/>At the end, it would not complete the boot up leaving the screen black.  I did factory resets twice to try to fix.  Factory resets are a major waste of time.  There are remaining FAILS on the diagnostic.

In the past few years, I have used Straight Talk service as I think the bigger networks are a pretty big rip-off. However, it is hard to get an affordable and decent unlocked phone for a decent price point.<br \/><br \/>A little about my tastes: I like Apple computers, but I am not a big fan of the iPhone anymore. They seem to have been confirmed as disposable pieces of garbage. I had a Samsung Galaxy 3 a few years ago that I loved but broke the screen on, and I followed that with Nexus 5 which was decent for a while but eventually kind of crapped out. After the Nexus, I went through a variety of refurbished phones (including an iPhone) and was in this cycle of terrible phones. My brother-in-law had the generation before Moto G Plus, and he said he loved it. So I looked into and have never looked back! First of all, the price point is amazing. Second of all, set up with Straight Talk is super easy. Third of all, this phone is sturdy! I have dropped it and use it a lot, and it is still holding up strong at the 6 month mark.<br \/><br \/>Both my brother-in-law (who works in software development), me, and my mother have this phone. So it's a great, affordable, but hardy solution for many different users.

I've had it for 2 weeks and so far I've had consistent issues with two areas. First, when I try to open an app, it appears to freeze up periodically. This is especially frustrating with taking pictures or video, where it even froze and didn't save a short video I took because it apparently couldn't handle the pressure and went into a forced reboot<br \/><br \/>The second issue is making calls is annoying. I've had it connect calls, but about 40% of the time you can't hear what's in the other side (while they can still hear you). It's also dropped calls on me multiple times, which I can only guess is related to the above issue.<br \/><br \/>The phone has a sleek design and I do enjoy a good deal of it, but if it can't perform the most basic functions, it feels useless.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great phone for the price and specs","text":"I got mine from Best buy but thought I'd share my experience with the phone. I'm coming from a Zenfone 3 max. The battery on the max plus does drain noticably faster than the other models but man does the screen look great! I've never seen a screen look this good. The cameras are great can record full 1080p. The phone is taller than the regular version and not as wide as first this bothered me a little bit but I realized it's much easier to use one handed than the other thicker models. Also take note the phone requires a nano SIM card I am having to wait for my new sim to arrive before I can call or text. The only downside I have experienced is the phone runs warm. It's normally sits around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. I installed the new pubg mobile game and it ran it perfectly but my phone was getting extremely warm not like it would burn you or anything just very warm but not a real issue the phone didn't crash or anything the game ran very stable.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Intuitive Interface Sacrificed But Resilient and & 4G Capable","text":"Intuitive Interface Sacrificed But Resilience & 4G Capable via Network Settings and Service Provider<br \/><br \/>When in need of a \u201cnon-smart phone\u201d that is tough, a \u201cflip\u201d model and at least 4G, the Pum Ram 8-4G is the ONLY model out there that appeared to qualify. The one or two other contenders offer 4G LTE (which, as I understand it, is sales talk for, \u201cfaster than 3G but not really 4G\u201d). These are factors that led to my purchase of this phone.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ll first address the negatives: Reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, indicate that though this phone is advertised as 4G, it is actually 3G. One such review cited a conversation with his AT&T rep who, based on what was on their computer after entering the IMIE, indicated the phone was 3G. If true this would expose Plum to deceptive trade practice litigation (DTP). I doubted this. So before purchasing, I twice e-mail the company regarding the matter. The manufacturer replied: \"3G version was discontinued in 2019. This version is 4G,\u201d and, \u201cDue to recent update in ATT system \u2013 any phone that is not 5G is being flagged as not compatible or 3G. Please inform the ATT rep that it is a 4G unlocked phone and they will make a note and you won\u2019t have any issues. This issue is also affecting all prepaid services that uses ATT network like Consumer cellular, Cricket, H2o, Pure Talk, Tracfone, Straight Talk etc.\"<br \/><br \/>When I gave to my service provider (Patriot Mobile) the IMIE numbers (there are two because the phone accommodates two sim cards) they only noted that the phone was not active\u2014duh\u2014and confirmed with me that it was unlocked.<br \/><br \/>The service I have (via Patriot) is from T-Mobile. However, the screen of the Plum Ram 8-4G indicates \u201c3G.\u201d I e-mailed Plum for clarification. Their response: \u201cIgnore the 3G sign\u2014it is 4G.\u201d<br \/><br \/>However, after looking through the phone\u2019s numerous screens and options, under \u201cSettings\u201d I found \u201cNetwork Settings\u201d and \u201cSIM1 network settings.\u201d Under this I found \u201cNetwork Selection\u201d and when selected it searched for and found T-Mobile\u2019s 4G and 3G Networks as well as AG&T\u2019s 4G Network. There is also a selection Mode that will pick the Network automatically or manually. Based on other settings in this section (under \u201cNetwork Information\u201d) I can see that I am on the 3G Network. I was able to switch the phone to 4G, but the service didn\u2019t connect. So I am thinking my SIM card and\/or service account is restricting me to the 3G. I\u2019ll pursue this further in order to figure out what is going on. But the end result of this information is that this Phone IS 4G capable and the access to that Network depends on either the SIM card or the service provider. Note: Even though I don\u2019t have an AT&T account, I could actually get the phone to connect their 4G Network but only for Emergencies\u2014and this is indicated when, instead of the main screen indicating \u201cWireless,\u201d it indicates \u201cEmergency.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that means for 9-1-1.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve read reviews that there are no volume controls on the phone. Not true. Page 11 of the manual (which is egregiously under-developed) shows the volume control and the video on Amazon shows how it is used. However, even these are not entirely\u2014or fully described. For example, there are no buttons on the outside of the phone, so if you want to control the ring volume you must either 1) use the center Menu\/Ok button (with its up, down, left and right arrows) OR; 2) Adjust the volume via the User Profile. To adjust using the first method, you must be receiving a call and press the up or down Menu\/Ok button. To adjust the ringer volume via method 2, Select \u201cUser Profile\u201d from the screen menu and under the \u201cGeneral\u201d Option (or one of the other four User Profiles), select \u201coptions,\u201d then \u201ccustomize\u201d and then \u201cRing tone volume.\u201d Even the most quite setting is more than enough.<br \/><br \/>So as is obvious, there are many things about this phone that are not intuitive or standard in other phones. You cannot, for example, put dashes in phone numbers that you save. If you save a phone number as a business number you cannot readily put it above the empty option for a cell number (although I think you might be able to make all entries do this via another menu option that I THINK I saw). The phone has a lap and split time stopwatch, but not a countdown stopwatch. It has a confusing \u201cnWay\u201d Stopwatch that displays four stopwatches at the same time, each controlled by the different direction buttons of the \u201cMenu\/Ok button.\u201d<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve read that that the company doesn\u2019t have a manual online. Not true. Go to the Plum Mobile website click the SUPPORT page. Alongside the Q&A section is a link for manuals. However as noted above, the manual is woefully brief as only the first 13 of 38 pages are the English instructions.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve read there is an issue with regard to receiving messages. Before giving up, and per the manual (page 10) check the APN settings. Also, rather than calling Plum Support, trying e-mailing. They have been prompt in responding to my several messages.<br \/><br \/>Now, about the phone more generally: I expected some rubber coating and it has none. But a video review I saw of the phone showed it taking some harsh abuse (tossed into muddy water, thrown to the ground, Tossed 30 feet into the air and hitting the ground, thrown into a cement wall and bouncing to the ground and being rolled over by one tire of a car. In each instance the phone in the video appeared unscathed.<br \/><br \/>The actual phone does feel a little light and the exterior seems unsubstantial. In a tactile sense, the plastic feels \u201ccheep\u201d while looking \u201ctough.\u201d But there is that video and I\u2019m not going to run it through the same paces. It is reportedly certified (IP-67\/68) to the highest waterproof rating, meaning it is supposed to be watertight for 20 minutes to a depth of  one meter (just a little over three feet). That, on top of being shock and dust resistant.  The phone appears fairly easy to use, but as noted above it is not particularly intuitive. It offers that second sim card slot (presumable for a second number and\/or for overseas use I believe). It also offers a micro card slot for expanding the memory up to a 32 gig micro card. There are also Internet settings (the above-referenced APN settings).<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ve read reviews that indicate it is not easy to charge or easily be set in the charger. Not so. When placed the phone in the cradle for charging the phone merely sits lightly on the contacts\u2014it doesn\u2019t \u201csnap in\u201d or lock. But the two lights on the cradle reflect when the phone is charging. The phone display, when on, will reflect the charging status only momentarily, then goes dark. The lights on the charging cradle are what tell you when it is fully charged. If that doesn\u2019t suit you, the cord that plugs into the cradle may, instead, be plugged directly into the side of the phone for charging.<br \/><br \/>The phone also has a built-in FM radio for which you can control the volume and I suspect that in adjusting the volume to that, you may also control either the earpiece or speaker volume. But that\u2019s just a guess\u2014I haven\u2019t tested it.<br \/><br \/>My overall opinion\u2026 Well, I am going to assume the resilience of the phone is as advertise and on a scale of 1 to 10 (with five being average), give THAT aspect of the phone a 10.<br \/><br \/>My experience with the company support is about an 8.<br \/><br \/>My impression of the phone\u2019s options, even with the internet option, is about 5 to 6 (again with 5 being average). I think the lack of a intuitive user interface and the loss of more familiar features, hurts this phone. And I don\u2019t think if a user was happy with a previous \u201ctough\u201d flip phone, they will be happy with this phone. Even if it is as stout as claimed, it is a vastly different creature in terms how the user interacts with it.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m also a little concerned about the battery life but can only rate it at about 5 to 6 for now. I\u2019m unsure of how much standby time the phone actually has or whether I can get a better longer-lasting battery.<br \/><br \/>The phone rates pretty high for video and photo options and enhancement: It has more than I expected and I\u2019ll give it a 6 to 7.<br \/><br \/>And as stated herein-above, the phone IS capable of 4G. For that the thing deserves a pretty high mark.<br \/><br \/>So, all of that together, at this point, and on the 1 to 10 scale (with 5 being average) I think I am generously rating it at a 5 to 6. I think that as I become more use to this phone my rating will improve.","images":[],"asin":"B07MJHLH72","parent_asin":"B07MJHLH72","user_id":"AG37FF6VPJXH5ZKPIUARGVTTUMHQ","timestamp":1620279445604,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":1531,"phone_score":0.916839242,"battery_score":0.916839242,"screen_score":0.916839242,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.916839242,"life_score":0.916839242,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.916839242,"battery life_score":0.916839242,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.916839242,"mobile_score":0.916839242,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.916839242,"app_score":0.916839242,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.916839242,"size_score":0.0}

The phone itself is great and looks really good. Our HUGE complaint is that when you buy a card of minutes and put on this phone the minutes are divided 3 ways, talk, text and data. As my son mostly texts and occasionally uses the data it works great for that. But right now he has over 250 min. of talk time on here that can not be used to text (which is 95% of what he wanted his phone for). I think that when we buy minutes for the phone, he should be able to use them however he wants. Almost all of his friends only use their phones to text and it is the easiest for us to communicate with him throughout the day as well.

For a $500 phone, face and fingerprint recognition are crazy fast.  The only problem is, face recognition doesn't work all the time.  Looks like it has some algorithm to capture the image within x seconds of picking it up after which it fails.  But not a big deal for my wife at least.  Their EMUI skin is not attractive in my opinion, but I have never been bothered too much by any skin, actually.  So not a big deal for me.  Speaker is fine, comparable to Galaxy S8 in my view.  Screen is bright, but I never keep it too bright to protect my eyes any ways.  Photos come out pretty good and can take fast photos.  The fact that this has audio jack plus the same processor as Mate 10 Pro and a $150 difference (Mate 10 Pro sells for $650 now) made this one my preferred device.

I am out in the elements all year round, so I am hoping that it handles the cold, wet, muddy, and hot weather through the seasons.","images":[],"asin":"B085WTR7BJ","parent_asin":"B085WTR7BJ","user_id":"AH6TN3XMVLG3F6FW25T6LNNTDCPQ","timestamp":1637278100297,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":128,"phone_score":0.8958069682,"battery_score":0.8958069682,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.8958069682,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.8958069682,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.8958069682,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

My G91 had slipped out of my pocket and fell 4 feet on a concrete floor; its screen was cracked even though the phone was in its case: the ugly black case that was shipped with the phone.<br \/><br \/>I was surprised and annoyed that a four-foot drop of the phone would have cracked its screen. So I decided the replacement phone will have to feature a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 or better. This phone sports the Gorilla Glass 5, so I hope it will survive a 4-feet-drop.<br \/><br \/>I do not like the shipped ugly black Blu's case that was shipped with it for two reasons: 1) The case is very hard and therefore does not protect the phone from a 4-feet drop to a hard surface. 2) The phone is beautiful--like a piece of art--but its beauty is completely masked when placed in the shipped ugly black case. Hence, I am now looking for a transparent shock-absorbent case for my new phone. Transparent because I want the phone's beauty to be visible to the world.<br \/><br \/>The phone excels in all other areas: good battery life, lots of memory, nice display, etc. So I will not elaborate on these features except to warn that it does not offer wireless charging and NFC.<br \/><br \/>I believe the purchase price of $199.00 makes it a very good budget: probably the best in terms of features vs price ratio.","images":[],"asin":"B0B3B8VY4D","parent_asin":"B0B3B8VY4D","user_id":"AF22XY7UAXF57NKMQBATKVJESYPA","timestamp":1661460941491,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":249,"phone_score":-0.6185036302,"battery_score":-0.6185036302,"screen_score":-0.6185036302,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":-0.6185036302,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":-0.6185036302,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.6185036302,"case_score":-0.6185035706,"features_score":-0.6185035706,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":-0.6185035706,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Works on Verizon! Ads aren't annoying","text":"Ive had this phone (the 64gb one) for over 2 months. As a former avid iPhone 6 user, it holds up pretty well! I was so hesitant to buy it partially because of all the reviews about the insane hassle Verizon puts you through to set up service. I got lucky by having a SIM card from my broken iPhone- it worked the second I inserted it! The fella at the Verizon store told me that I would have been &#34;out of luck&#34; if I didn't have a nano, non NFC SIM card that was already attached to my phone number. (Sounds from the other comments like buying and activating a SIM is possible tho.) Some calls broke up at first but I disabled &#34;enhanced 4g LTE mode&#34; and haven't had a problem since. I got the version with the ads and thankfully, they are ridiculously unobtrusive. They only go full screen if you have no notifications, aka almost never. Love the battery life- way better than the old iPhone. I like the camera well enough too. Attached are some photos I've taken with it. Also attached is a photo of the ad\/ notification screen. The built in speaker is at least as loud as my bf's iPhone 6 but a bit tinny sounding in comparison (not too noticably). The only issues I have are 1: videos are pretty grainy and 2: some apps occasionally freeze up and quit unexpectedly. Not too big of a deal, but it happens a couple times a week. Also this will matter to like 0.01 of you but there are several glitches with Instagram stories. It auto rotates and crops out the sides of pictures I took with my phone sideways. Videos will sometimes fail to upload even with WiFi and you have to retry them. And when I do a few videos in a row, they post and look fine on other people's phones but often won't play when I try to rewatch my own story. That said- who cares? Sweet phone.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"This phone is for the traveler or a person who just wants the basics.","text":"This phone is a quad band GSM phone and will work virtually everywhere on the planet with a cellphone signal. I already own a smart phone for use at home and I needed something to make phone calls with while traveling in other countries. This phone has everything that I needed. It has a built in flashlight that I can turn on without hassle when I need it. It also plays mp3 files that can be loaded to the optional micro SD card (2gb max). It comes with clear instructions, a headset, and a charger. The greatest thing about the phone, to me, is that the phone, while it is small(about the length of a deck of cards) it can hold two sim cards simultaneously. This allows you to talk on two different networks with the same phone. That allows me to keep my high dollar phone at home, load a cheap pre-paid sim card from Ma Bell, or that T company here in the USA, and load a pre-paid sim card from my destination at the same time. One phone, two countries, no commitments or contracts. Life is good! Battery life is good. And the traveler friendly charger is rated for 100-240v. All you need is a plug adapter and voila, instant gratification. When and if this phone dies, I'm buying another.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"The Answer to ALL my Problems","text":"OK, maybe not all my problems, but definitely all my phone problems. I was addicted to social media and time-wasting phone games; mostly solitaire. At a certain point, I felt like I was rotting my brain, so I decided to try a flip phone. This was partially awesome, as talking on a phone that was actually designed to be used AS A PHONE is so much more comfortable. But texting sucked, I couldn't really send or receive pictures on it, and it had no easily accessible navigation. So for the two years I had it, I also continued to lug around my old smartphone, like a damned albatross, using my flip phone's hot spot to do all the things I was trying to avoid. Well, one fateful day, I sat on the old smartphone and destroyed the screen, so it was time to try something new. I had initially settled on just getting a new smartphone, so I set about trying to choose one. But what had happened in the intervening 5 years or so since I had purchased the last one? Everything got even bigger. Basically phones are tablets now. I hate it. So I googled \"small smartphone\", and eventually stumbled upon this thing. At first I was skeptical, but the price was decent and the reviews were good, so I decided to give it a shot.<br \/><br \/>In short, I LOVE THIS PHONE.<br \/><br \/>Not only is it ADORABLE, it's easy to carry around - it even fits in the coin pocket of most jeans, easy to talk on, durable - with included case and screen protector, and it looks and sounds great. Signal quality seems better than my flip phone, which was pretty good. The battery life is way better than I hoped. It easily lasts all day for me with regular usage. The screen looks great and is very accurate and responsive. The 3-tap zoom feature is a nice touch. Typing on it takes a little getting used to, but overall works better than I expected. I still make a lot of errors but it's way faster than texting on the flip phone. It also has swype and autocomplete, so unless you have huge sausage fingers, it's very usable.<br \/><br \/>My only major complaint about the phone is that the GPS is consistently inaccurate, so if you rely on the \"robot lady\" to navigate for you, it's gonna be a problem. I generally use navigation interactively, keeping my map in \"north up\" view and following along as I go rather than just taking its direction, so for my purposes it's not that big of a deal if the \"robot lady\" thinks I'm on a parallel street and starts telling me to make nonsensical turns. But yeah, I'd say this might be a deal-breaker for someone who does rely on that turn-by-turn navigation.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a great little phone and it truly has changed my habits.

Historically, my average phone lifespan was about 6 months until I got the first Brigadier.  It's been years since then, but I think two years is about the ideal point of planned retirement.  My 6810 functioned well for about 18 months but has slowed significantly and the battery life is just abysmal.  It will be down to 50% within a few hours of use and pretty much has to stay on a charger whenever one is available.  The \"refurbished\" replacement I bought this past summer was even worse.  Looking brand new right out of the packaging, it's performance was even worse than my 2+ year old phone.  FYI: the new version of this phone, 6910, is just a repackaged 6810.

I thought is might be too big, but it fits nicely in my hand. I needed expandable storage, clear loud speakers and adequate performance, and the Nord N10 meets those requirements. It has a nice clean Android install without bloatware with some nice customization options. The camera takes great photos, the battery lasts me all day, the display screen is beautiful (I turned down refresh down from 90 to 60Hz because I don't notice any difference and it saves battery), has a headphone jack, and the phone operates really smoothly. I don't play any OS intensive games so I can't comment on that. Other reviews have commented on cons that it doesn't have a OnePlus physical alert slider, but I never had one so I don't miss it. I've been looking for a good midrange phone and this is without a doubt the best currently available for $300. The only con I have found is sometimes the fingerprint reader is slow or unresponsive, but it's only a second away to enter the PIN.

I would also since it's unlocked dual sim card, the best option for service with the blu products would be with Solavei\/T-mobile phone service.

Plus, I hear that if you share with 3 people you get i think like $20 for every 3 people and if you refer 9 people you made enough to cover your bill and your phone bill is free. So, yes I will be connecting my Blu phone when i order it with that company.

I plugged it in to charge the battery as instructed and the phone powered up quickly with a screen that was easy to see.  It would have been perfect for me--if I spoke fluent SPANISH!!  All of the menus and phone screens were in Spanish and I don't understand it at all!!  I searched online, found numerous suggested fixes to convert the phone to English and tried them all--but nothing worked.  Google Translator couldn't even identify some of the words on the screens for me!  I even inserted a brand new SIM card but everything was still in Spanish.  The instructions with the phone were very poor and very minimal and nothing addressed the default language and how to change it.  I'm petty savvy with electronics but this phone stumped me!  I have no complaints with the return policy--it was efficient and I received a prompt refund.  In conclusion, I really liked the phone design, appearance, weight for travel, etc. but the language barrier was a deal breaker for me.  I think the item description was remiss in not clearly stating that the phone would arrive with a Spanish language default and no instructions on how to change it!","images":[],"asin":"B00AA6WX2M","parent_asin":"B00AA6WX2M","user_id":"AEI6TSUOIJTEQREWHD2USGWKJJSQ","timestamp":1402959091000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":245,"phone_score":0.9561378956,"battery_score":0.9561378956,"screen_score":0.9561378956,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9561378956,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

Very defective and people are some people are tolerant to a device that fails because the price. but thinking of what you can loose, as an example pictures-moments, important personal and business calls, notes, docs, etc. is not worthy to get a BLU.<br \/><br \/>BLU Products company have a three-six weeks response for the failing phone process. can you wait that time? they will send you another defective product that you will put a lot of time setting it up but after one or two weeks you will get to the same place, another defective device!!!. so another waste of time and money. At the end they will offer you another phone model but they will only discount you 25 dollars of your defective phone so for a phone that you paid $200-$300 a few months ago you can only get $25 credit. You loose money, time , moments, opportunities when you go with BLU. so don't put any energy on this company , they are not serious and don't care about customer satisfaction.<br \/><br \/>look for complains online they have a lot","images":[],"asin":"B0129TQJJU","parent_asin":"B0129TQJJU","user_id":"AGFGUBNQGTYDQYWH5IQ736YBF56A","timestamp":1448387222000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":247,"phone_score":-0.9811031818,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":-0.9811031818,"phones_score":-0.9811031818,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.9811031818,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

My first impression is that the hardware was excellent, especially at this price point and the proprietary operating system was a bit buggy, but that wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for me.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>Excellent battery life<br \/>Good cameras, especially at this price point<br \/>Fast finger print reader<br \/>Decent build quality<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>Does not support many U.S. LTE bands (cross check with your carrier)<br \/>Screen brightness is good, but the screen is very reflective making it difficult to see in bright light<br \/>Screen appears to have a polarizing filter, meaning if you are wearing polarized sunglasses you will NOT be able to see the screen when holding the phone horizontally. This is very inconvenient, especially for taking horizontal photos on bright days.<br \/>Audio quality when using headphones is not as good as other phones I have owned<br \/>Intermittent issues with vibration alerts<br \/>Proprietary MIUI works well enough but it can be buggy and inconsistent at times<br \/><br \/>After using it for a few days I started to notice a few of the issues noted above that I unfortunately just can\u2019t get past so I will be returning the phone. For me, the biggest issue is band compatibility for Metro PCS. I\u2019m not very well versed in mobile lingo but I read many reviews that stated it worked well with Metro. I would say it works okay but I found that it did not work as well as my old Honor 8. After doing a bit more research I discovered that Metro operates it\u2019s LTE service on six different bands. This phone only supports two of those six and the Honor supports three of the six. The one band that the Honor supports that this one doesn\u2019t is band 12, which I understand helps with cell reception indoors and in some rural areas. I like the phone enough that I would be willing to accept the other flaws I mentioned but the poor reception compared to my old phone is a deal breaker for me. It\u2019s an awesome phone if it works well on your network, but do your research and make sure it supports the bands you need.","images":[],"asin":"B07QK32C8M","parent_asin":"B07QK32C8M","user_id":"AGHGHHIVVCYAS2PMFKNPXY46NHUA","timestamp":1565714595967,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":382,"phone_score":0.8416332006,"battery_score":0.8416332006,"screen_score":0.8416332006,"camera_score":0.8416332006,"price_score":0.8416332006,"phones_score":0.8416332006,"life_score":0.8416332006,"quality_score":0.8416332006,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.8416332006,"battery life_score":0.8416332006,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.8416332006,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.8416332006,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.8416332006,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Beyond Basic, Bad Sound Quality, Drops Calls","text":"I just wanted a pocketable quad-band GSM phone that does well at making and taking calls--nothing else. No texting, no Bookface, no Internet, camera optional. Unfortunately, this phone proved unable to meet this simple requirement. Fortunately, Amazon stood behind its guarantee and gave me a full refund, shipping included.<br \/><br \/>This phone seemd to fit the bill. And with the Amazon $40 credit for opening their credit card, it was free. (By the way, this phone is the same as the T200 except for the dual sim slots.) I really, really wanted it to work. And for almost a week, I learned to accept its many baffling quirks.<br \/><br \/>The one \"quirk\" I could not accept is that it routinely drops calls when I talk to my dad, who uses a landline in a small town. (It also dropped a call several times to a friend who's on Verizon Wireless, but I chalked that up to a major rainstorm.) Dad noted, when I called him back on my wife's iPhone (also on AT&T), that the call quality was markedly better. So I'm returning this phone, even though I like its small size and simplicity.<br \/><br \/>PROs:<br \/><br \/>* This phone is TINY. It might be the smallest phone available now. About half an inch longer than a credit card. If you remember the tiny candy-bar phones people were using around 2000, it's just like those. Super light. Very pocketable, but the size means the navigation ring is also tiny.<br \/><br \/>* The speakerphone is loud on my end.<br \/><br \/>* Typical of GSM phones, the battery life is good. The phone lasted just about six days on its first charge, including a couple of long calls and many short ones, plus liberal use of the flashlight.<br \/><br \/>* That flashlight is decently bright and very handy. If you buy this phone, make sure to turn off the keypad lock when you first get the phone. Then hold down the middle button inside the navigation ring to turn on the flashlight.<br \/><br \/>* No camera means less to go wrong.<br \/><br \/>* Two SIM card slots. (You cannot rename them, but that's OK by me.) A good capability to have for overseas trips with a spouse or partner.<br \/><br \/>* I like the phone's appearance--solid matte black. It's not slippery at all, yet its rounded corners make it very unobtrusive in the pants pocket.<br \/><br \/>CONs:<br \/><br \/>* Dropped calls. I routinely get a frustrating \"no network\" warning, even when I'm calling from our house, which is smack inside a major metropolitan area. We have no problems getting AT&T on other phones. I think this phone's reception problems are due to the phone's lack of any 3G capability, such as EDGE\/UMTS\/HSDPA, etc. It can't be AT&T's network, because my wife's iPhone 3G (and even my bare-bones Samsung SGH-107) do just fine.<br \/><br \/>* Incredibly, there is no instant-hush button to quickly silence the phone if it rings. You can, however, program one of the nav-ring directions to go to User Profiles. And from there, you can go to \"silent\"--meaning a total of four clicks to shut the thing up. Alternatively, you can press # to put it on vibrate--or turn it off. This is a major omission.<br \/><br \/>* Bad sound quality for those on the other end--at least for some people.<br \/><br \/>* The speakerphone, though loud as can be on my end, left one caller saying there was a weird noise on his end. But other calls on speakerphone have been OK.<br \/><br \/>* The navigation ring is very narrow--so much so that it's clickable only via fingernail.<br \/><br \/>* Keypad buttons are separated only by horizontal creases--no actual grooves, and nothing vertically. So you can't dial by touch. (This does, however, seem like it would prevent crumbs or other gunk from getting under the keypad.) This phone is not for the  visually impaired, the arthritic, or the clumsy. Or those with long fingernails.<br \/><br \/>* The icon for signal strength doesn't work on this phone, at least for AT&T. Maybe that's to be expected, as it's not one of their phones. The battery icon does work, though.<br \/><br \/>* There are only 9 speed dial numbers, and no. 1 is automatically voicemail if you're on AT&T.<br \/><br \/>* You can't do speed dial via pressing then number and then \"send\"; the only option is to hold the number down. Similarly, you can't hold down the \"send\" button to dial the last number called or received, as you can with LG and Samsung phones (and perhaps others). This is very annoying if you're used to doing number plus send.<br \/><br \/>* The call log doesn't separate missed\/sent\/received calls, instead listing them together, each type with a different icon.<br \/><br \/>* The FM radio works only with earphones (though this is commonly the case).<br \/><br \/>* There is no external volume on the side--you must use the navigation ring's up or down keys during a call.<br \/><br \/>* You can't turn on the speakerphone until a call has been made or received.<br \/><br \/>* I would prefer a generic, old-school, non-musical ringtone. But one of the three included has become strangely pleasing: a fast waltz in a minor key, of all things. The others are like something from a 1997 Belgrade karaoke bar. There isn't a non-musical ringtone, unfortunately.<br \/><br \/>* I hate the wallpaper--purple with some dumb DJ character. Blech. You can't change it unless you download your own wallpaper; this is the only one included on the phone.<br \/><br \/>* There is no voice dialing.<br \/><br \/>* No Bluetooth!<br \/><br \/>* The English manual is a comically bad translation. (Evidently, even Google Translate is banned in China.) It's positively incomprehensible in places. Worse, the page numbers in the table of contents are wrong; that's just lazy. And the SAR is not mentioned anywhere.<br \/><br \/>TIPS:<br \/><br \/>* I almost thought there were no speed dials, because they are for some reason not mentioned in the manual. And they're not where you'd expect them, under Address book. Reach them via Menu\/Call Center\/General call settings\/4--speed dial.<br \/><br \/>* The battery cover is not intuitive, and the manual doesn't tell you how to open it. Use a fingernail to pry open from the end with the slot, and then do the same via the side. (I.e., pry it up but don't try to slide it down.)<br \/><br \/>* The manual tells you to charge the battery for 12 hours the first time; they must be stuck in 1995, because it's a Li-ion battery. There is NO need to do this for Li-ion batteries. (The quickstart menu says to charge it for 24 hours!)<br \/><br \/>*To do anything on the phone, you have to wake it up out of standby first, by pressing any key.<br \/><br \/>* FYI: The languages available on the phone are English, Spanish, and Portuguese. (The founders of Blu are Brazilian.)<br \/><br \/>CONCLUSION:<br \/><br \/>I had thought this phone would be great for a calls-only luddite like me. Alas, it was not. I was even accepting of the phone's many annoying quirks, thinking it was worth it to have a phone that is so small I wouldn't avoid carrying it. It does have some cool features (e.g., the flashlight, FM radio, and dual SIM slots). But there are some unforgivable interface omissions--no silent button? REALLY?--and functions are not mapped intuitively.<br \/><br \/>Most importantly, a phone has to be able to reliably make and take calls. That means not dropping them.<br \/><br \/>BLU Products needs to do some basic user testing before introducing products onto the market. Props to Amazon, though, for standing behind its customers.","images":[],"asin":"B004WJUNXE","parent_asin":"B004WJUNXE","user_id":"AE5HANX4FUO3RX2H54SVODSDYNCQ","timestamp":1316977590000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":1287,"phone_score":0.7574443221,"battery_score":0.7574443221,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.7574443221,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.7574443221,"life_score":0.7574443221,"quality_score":0.7574443221,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.7574443221,"case_score":0.7574443221,"features_score":0.7574443221,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.7574443221,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.7574443221}

The Moto G on prepaid no commitment subsidy is a great deal. Lacks the screen size and storage of my nexus 5 but works almost as well.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Almost Everything I Want From A Smart Phone","text":"I misplaced my (Verizon) Treo 650 and eventually gave up and decided to replace it after whinging about with my daughter's old LG.  Since the rest of the family is on AT&T, I looked at the iPhone but went back to another Treo.  (The iPhone user interface is superb, but I found the keyboard unusable for emails\/memos\/text messages, and I don't often listen to music or watch videos on my phone, so those otherwise great features were not of interest to me.  And AT&T had a great rebate.)  So I acquired a crimson treo...maybe I'll have a harder time losing it!<br \/><br \/>If you've owned a Treo, this has all the advantages of the family, using the Palm OS, which I prefer to Windows Mobile.  If you've not owned a smart phone before, they are a tremendous productivity booster, and I can say from personal experience what a setback it is to return to a regular cell phone.  The 680 synched up quickly with my laptop.  (I followed the instructions and re-installed HotSync, assuming I would be re-entering a lot of names, but it saved everything from my lost Treo.)  I use email from Earthlink and Yahoo as well as corporate Outlook and it works seamlessly.<br \/><br \/>(There was one problem with Outlook and my prior 650 - Versamail could not handle the it's-time-to-change-your-password message and woudl lock up.  I don't know if it's going to be an issue with the 680 or not, but a password change on the 650 took care of the problem.  YMMV.)<br \/><br \/>Battery life has been a common complaint of early 680 users.  There are two factors here.  First, the battery is smaller to help make the phone slimmer, and I like the new form factor.  I regularly just plug it into the car charger and it's not an issue.  The other factor is the firmware - before version 1.09, there were some battery-draining bugs in the 680.  All the Treo forums I've researched have indicated that the May upgrade corrects most of the battery issues.  There are now extended batteries available as well, although they require a different cover and make the phone larger.<br \/><br \/>I have not looked at all of the negative reviews, but I think that most of them will be from before May 2007, when the AT&T version of the upgrade became available.  So I would suggest that readers consign these to the dustbin of history -- it's not a huge problem anymore.<br \/><br \/>There are a couple of drawbacks to the 680 for the 650 user besides the smaller battery.  There is no Wi-Fi card available for the 680, which would be useful in the future.  The SD card has been moved to the side from the top, which makes it harder to accidentally pop out the card.  The 680 SD cover seems flimsy, but will probably be OK if one is careful to replace it correctly.<br \/><br \/>So...if you want a lighter weight Treo than a 650, and can manage to charge the battery daily, the 680 should meet your needs.  I am ecstatic to have a Treo again, and the 680 has yet to disappoint me.  Highly recommended.","images":[],"asin":"B000KPY83K","parent_asin":"B000KPY83K","user_id":"AHTYWF5DGTAZNTX7BWVCZXWVSIWA","timestamp":1184547580000,"helpful_vote":20,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":532,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great 4G phone at a Great Price","text":"This is my second Hydro Series phone from Boost Mobile with my first being a C5170 first generation Hydro. First off I have to say that there is no learning curve from upgrading from Ice Cream Sandwich to KitKat. So that was one headache I avoided like when I upgraded to ICS from Gingerbread.<br \/><br \/>The main reason I bought the Kyocera Hydro Icon was because I dropped my first generation Hydro from a rooftop and the volume buttons popped out, but I was wanting to upgrade for the 4G capability anyway. I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma which has great 4G coverage, at least when you are outdoors. I live in a basement apartment which faces away from the cell tower, and the lobal effects from that tower means I only get one or two bars of signal strength in my apartment. One thing that upset me about the Sprint\/Boost Mobile 4G coverage maps is that they show total 4G coverage for a county that only has one or two 4G towers. So while visiting my father in rural Cherokee County I was left with a very weak 3G coverage that is set up for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol cruiser laptops. Other than that, I love this phone.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>A great phone if you cannot afford an iPhone or Galaxy.<br \/>Is wireless magnetic induction charging capable with PMA chargers, and the induction coil is already built into the rear case of the ICON. Amazon sells a very cheap Duracell Double PMA charger.<br \/>The Smart Sonic Receiver sounds a little tinny, but is very audible in noisy environments.<br \/>Has a few built in apps like a flashlight timer\/stopwatch and an Accuweather widget so you don't have to worry about downloading unsecure apps.<br \/>The phone has an unlocked FM Radio chip and comes with the NextRadio app that doesn't eat up data. You will need a wired headset or headphones to act as an antenna for the FM Radio chip.<br \/>Unlockable SIM chip. I guess that may come in handy if you travel overseas.<br \/>Four gigabytes of internal storage, so you can fill your SD card with music and movies and not full of apps.<br \/>Water Resistant. Kyocera says waterproof, but I say waterproof does not come with a depth limit nor time limit<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>Sprint\/Boost Mobile bloatware. The worst offenders are Connection Optimizer, Mobile ID, Boost Zone and the Lumen Toolbar. You can disable Connection Optimizer and the Lumen Toolbar, but they re-enable themselves when you restart the phone.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Overall good with only a few issues","text":"**** UPDATE: Still a great phone nearly a year later, but will no longer work in the U.S. due to VoIP and Enhanced LTE requirements. THIS PHONE IS NO LONGER COMPATIBLE FOR ACTIVATION ON AT&T OR T-MOBILE. If you are on AT&T now with a Redmi Note 8, it will work for a period of time, but eventually will not be able to handle voice calls. New ones cannot be activated at all.<br \/><br \/>ORIGINAL REVIEW: I waited until I have been using the phone for a couple of weeks to write this. I wasn't sure about buying an international phone for use in the US and from a company I was unfamiliar with in terms of hands-on experience. This phone turns out to be a quality product. I won't run down all the specs as you can read them for yourself.<br \/><br \/>One thing I felt the need to do was install a third party launcher first thing. I don't like the MIUI much and I am used to being able to remove any or all icons from any home screen. You cannot with the stock launcher on this phone. Worse, there is no easy access to the app drawer, leaving you with a more iPhone-like experience. I don't like that experience *** UPDATE - You can now remove home screen icons and there is  a setting to enable the app drawer with the MIUI 12 update<br \/><br \/>Battery life is good. Cell signals have been solid. Sound is good. Camera is very good. Performance is very decent and the software is stable. One thing I really appreciate is the fact that it has a notification LED and I really like the way it is implemented. It is easy enough to see when blinking, but it's actually quite subtle at the same time. Not distracting or obnoxious. Very good balance there.<br \/><br \/>I have had no issues using this phone on the AT&T network in the US. Solid connections and data speeds that are at least as good as other US based phones I have used. If you are in the US and are thinking about this phone, I would recommend that you download a free app that shows you your current phones cell connection info. There are several such apps available. Those apps will tell you which LTE bands you are currently using so you can see if this phone has those bands. Check the LTE band info on your current phone for a few days in different locations to see all the bands that you might need. If you can match those up to this phone's bands, you should be all set. If not, then you should avoid this one.<br \/><br \/>There have been reports of advertisements on this phone. You can go into Security and Privacy and disable the ads or do like I did and use a 3rd party launcher like Nova or Evie etc. Also I don't use the preinstalled apps.<br \/><br \/>Overall this phone is worth the price if you like the out-of-box experience OR don't mind using third party launchers and doing some of your own personalizing.","images":[],"asin":"B07YJHXZT6","parent_asin":"B07YJHXZT6","user_id":"AH2PK5HY33XNYUGW73LMVWQP52QQ","timestamp":1595176793716,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":525,"phone_score":-0.6667974591,"battery_score":-0.6667974591,"screen_score":-0.6667974591,"camera_score":-0.6667974591,"price_score":-0.6667974591,"phones_score":-0.6667974591,"life_score":-0.6667974591,"quality_score":-0.6667974591,"apps_score":-0.6667974591,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.6667974591,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":-0.6667974591,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.6667974591,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":-0.6667974591,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"I'd Rather Have a Different Phone","text":"I got this phone because of the price for the features but I prefer my old phone despite this one being slightly more advanced. The finger recognition is in the WORST spot. Why put it on the on button? Every time I press it I end up unlocking my phone when I just want to see the time and it gets confused when I want to turn it off because it thinks I am trying to use my finger. It also comes on too often. I press the off button to turn it off and when it finally does it comes back on at the slightest touch. My old phone allowed you to double tap the screen in order to turn it on or off, but this one makes it stay off unless you press the dreaded power button. The battery life sucks. It charges way too slowly and drain fast. I just got this so this shouldn't be the case and my last phone lasted longer despite all the time I had it. I think the front camera could be better, but it is an android. The feature that tells the weather is not accurate by any means. The screenshot feature is not convenient and I am not sure what it's called but that feature that allows you to look at the recently used apps and swipe them is not convenient either. You have to be in another app to use and not not the home screen. Not sure why that is a thing. I could probably think of more things that annoy me about this, but all that was off the top of my head. It has good features like the audio, but it lacks so much that I had to focus on them.","images":[],"asin":"B09CLNH78M","parent_asin":"B09CLNH78M","user_id":"AEHOZCNSMOKNQOVOQZIX5A5FICOA","timestamp":1668327700897,"helpful_vote":9,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":296,"phone_score":-0.8542836308,"battery_score":-0.8542836308,"screen_score":-0.8542836308,"camera_score":-0.8542836308,"price_score":-0.8542836308,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":-0.8542836308,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.8542836308,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.8542836308,"case_score":-0.8542836308,"features_score":-0.8542836308,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.8542836308,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

What I need is a PHONE, not a computer!<br \/>so now I have no phone to use and i wasted hours and hours of time and trouble, and money.","images":[],"asin":"B07GBRB55Z","parent_asin":"B07GBRB55Z","user_id":"AHNTC3TKQPGKUOD5CCINRDMFZNYQ","timestamp":1643249073795,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":131,"phone_score":-0.9114838243,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I have become accustomed to making calls at my desk at work and at home with my older phones but with the 535, I'd have to go outside at work in order to receive or make a call.  The clarity of videos and stills was also noticeably inferior to what I am accustomed to shooting on my economy Nokias.  I had expected a step up from the 520 and 521 but I was disappointed.

I spent an extra $50 and upgraded to the 5th generation model that includes 4GB of RAM instead of 2GB, plus 64GB of memory instead of 32GB. The memory doesn't matter because for $20 you can buy a 20GB micro card, but the 4GB RAM is significant because when I check RAM usage its always between 2 and 3 (never over 3), but if I only had 2GB this device would be bogged down significantly. Aside from that all the &#34;Moto&#34; hand gestures are really great. When I twist my wrist quickly twice the camera instantly turns on and ready to shoot before I look at the screen - Amazing. I missed so many pictures with my old Samsung waiting to open the camera app. All the unlock screen options are a bit over-whelming. I have face detection (yes there is a built in app for face detection), finger print pad, pattern from 12 fixed dots or type in a password. Whew. I use none of them... Bottom line is that this model phone is blazing fast, has a bright screen, has all the features of a $1,000 phone and more.

I did eventually break it and had to use this phone.<br \/><br \/>Now this phone is absolutely horrible. Out of the thousands of dollars of things I purchased in 2023, this is the thing I regret buying most.<br \/><br \/>This phone reminds me of the $20 phones that Cricket used to sell in 2010. It is so slow that you have to be a Zen master to deal with the app or website load times. Its pretty much torture to use this phone and I cannot count the number of times I have restrained myself from throwing this phone against a wall or stomping it to bits.<br \/><br \/>The screen is so dim that you can barely use it outside with sunglasses. The screen also barely responds to clicks and this is ultra irritating because apps regularly take a few seconds to respond to clicks. So this means that if you buy this, you should get used to waiting 3 seconds after you click the screen to see if the phone actually responds or to see if the screen actually detected your finger clicking. Infuriating.<br \/><br \/>The battery is complete trash. Takes 12 hours for a full charge. If you wake up on a Saturday morning and use this phone for 3 hours, the battery will be under 40% and require about 8 hours of charging to get back to full.<br \/><br \/>Also the phone regularly turns itself back on when you turn it off so I recommend keeping the battery saver on constantly and also carrying a charging block. If you have a job that requires you to be available by phone, forget about it. If you travel a lot and need navigation to get around, forget about it. Horrible GPS and the battery dies quicker.<br \/><br \/>I've lost this phone in my house before a flight and tried to call it. Straight to voicemail, over and over. Missed my flight. I eventually found it and it never received any of the calls. Some people cannot call me on this phone no matter how many times they dial.<br \/><br \/>Im posting this from a new BL8800 Pro, which is like a bigger, nicer BV9900 Pro that does 5G.

Save your dollars and buy one of the Blackview FLIR equipped flagship phones instead, but expect bad customer service.<br \/><br \/>The only people I would recommend this to are 1) people switching from a ten year old phone and 2) people switching from a flip phone.<br \/><br \/>One star.","images":[],"asin":"B07T6ZDRHV","parent_asin":"B07T6ZDRHV","user_id":"AFQ5M77IRU5V5LPUXEBR4PFHKW5A","timestamp":1674261157778,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":455,"phone_score":-0.9762716293,"battery_score":-0.9762716293,"screen_score":-0.9762716293,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.9762716293,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.9762716293,"service_score":-0.9762716293,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.9762716293,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9762716293,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Complete Junk","text":"There is no other way to describe this phone. A disappointment because up until now, all of my LG phones have been good. This phone arrived locked. The default lock code is normally the last 4 digits of the phone number. That was of no value because the phone had not been activated and had no phone number. I spoke with people at TracFone and LG. We tried using different 4 number codes to unlock the phone with no success. We tried numerous ways to do a factory reset on the phone with no success. In the course of all this, the phone somehow called 911, even though it had not been activated. This caused problems with the local authorities. The Unlock button is right next to the Emergency button. A poor placement of these buttons. I can see this would be an ongoing problem with this phone. The last TracFone agent I spoke with told me I should return the phone as defective. Enough of this for sure.<br \/><br \/>An update... Since this fiasco, I have discovered: Even prior to the phone being activated, it does have a phone number. The number may be something like: 000 000 2436 . Before you do Anything else with this phone, write down the last 4 digits of the phone number. This is the Lock Code. The phone number can be found in the Prepaid menu or in Settings. If the phone locks for some reason, you will need this code to unlock it. Otherwise, the phone will become useless if it accidentally gets locked. This lock code will change once the phone is activated and a phone number is issued.

It's a nice stylish entry level smartphone with an excellent display that looks similar to a Flagship\/High Dollar phone quality wise. The battery life isn't that great for a smartphone in this day and time and the phone doesn't wirelessly charge. You need to use a certain Qi-compatible wireless charging pad, to charge this phone. I don't want to but a fourth wireless charging pad and I have to charge it daily. I sometimes need to close an app, text... when the device stalls while processing. That detracts from what could make this an excellent smartphone. There's not a lot of memory on this device. You definitely need to buy an additional memory card. I had to manually load the pictures on to my SD card to transfer them on to the G7 Fit.<br \/><br \/>The main reason to buying this is the \"Bang for the Buck. If you can live with drawbacks like battery life, device running warm, and occasional processing taking longer than a higher end phones, then you will get a performance that few other entry level or midrange smartphones offer (My last phone was a Galaxy S10+. So I'm used to faster processing speeds ((But I'm comparing a $900+ phone to a $169.00 phone.)). Ultimately, the phone is best suited people who aren't on the phone constantly, watching lots of YouTube videos, gaming... and have access to a power source. It would be a GREAT kids entry level phone since it's shock and water resistant (A must for 8-12 year old's or careless teens), and a great \"Bang for the Buck.\"","images":[],"asin":"B083589DF5","parent_asin":"B083589DF5","user_id":"AFNJ7VZS5RT4SRBTSEJBOQ5QU2TA","timestamp":1594738339575,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":279,"phone_score":-0.7092530727,"battery_score":-0.7092530727,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.7092530727,"life_score":-0.7092530727,"quality_score":-0.7092530727,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.7092530727,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.7092530727,"memory_score":-0.7092530727,"app_score":-0.7092530727,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":-0.7092530727,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"True Zorch! Three steps forward if you need them.","text":"First, my install was simple, no sync problems. Activation was simple; and I was up and running in under an hour. What slowed me down was attempting to install Vindigo and Zagot for MS Mobile. They don't work yet, and I miss their utility. I had none of the problems as described in sync-ing and I am very impressed how easy the system downloaded the audible player and audible books to the SD card.<br \/><br \/>Second. This is not a Palm, in that the features are not as clear, but there are in the order of ten times more features programs and settings that can help you. In sum, it is to your advantage the way having a modern laptop of any OS is more helpful than a TRS 80. So having started with a Treo 180; a Treo 300; a 600 and a 650 now I have this 700w, there is no question in my mind that what you get is much more power: Zorch as Prof. Soloway likes to say. And it is a lot of Zorch. I walk around listening to an audio book -- not on Bluetooth due to some reason -- email comes in, I can respond. A phone call arrives, the audible player knows to stop; I take the call; finish; the audible player continues the book. The same works with music.<br \/><br \/>Finally and most importantly there is a five to ten times increase in download speed. This means everything if you Google some information during a conversation or if you need to look something up while you read Ted Koppel's comments in the NYT Select section. Having page loads occur in a snap, email come in fast, having your search results returned in the middle of the conversation rather than after everyone has gone onto the next topic -- leaving you still attempting to find the historical or scientific fact -- is simply worth a whole lot. Speed kills, in the metaphorical sense.<br \/><br \/>Can we complain about MS design, sure? Do we get to waste another half day to a day learning a new toy, sure. Is there some pain? Sure! But when we are working do we get this significantly increased Zorch for our personal use. Yes Sir! Praise goes to the techno Gods for this is a truly amazing personal computational device.","images":[],"asin":"B000E6MFXA","parent_asin":"B000E6MFXA","user_id":"AHUJ36ELZOEDYIFA5DZMW4QNQV4A","timestamp":1138331923000,"helpful_vote":20,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":393,"phone_score":0.9434726834,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9434726834,"mobile_score":0.9434726834,"device_score":0.9434726834,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Too slow for the average user.","text":"EDIT: After living with this phone for a few months I'm dropping my rating to two stars.<br \/><br \/>Purchased this online directly from TracFone on sale for $30. Seemed like a good deal at the time...<br \/><br \/>Lasted about 4 or 5 months before the phone mic stopped working. Seems like low end ZTE phones suffer from this. I've heard it's from the mic's dust cover getting dislodged and covering the mic. Can't say for sure. Other issues are as follows, and persisted the whole time I owned the phone.<br \/><br \/>Screen:<br \/>Occasionally the screen will refuse to turn on. Buttons will light up but are unresponsive. This requires you to pull out the battery and restart the phone. Snap cases are a bad idea because you'll just break the clasps from having to remove it so often.<br \/><br \/>Some phone's proximity sensors are poorly calibrated, meaning you pull your face away from phone while making a call and the screen doesn't come back on. This means, yep, pulling out the battery to end the call. ZTE does have a calibration app to fix this though (worked for me).<br \/><br \/>Speed\/Responsiveness:<br \/>Don't set your expectations too high. Only has a single core processor. If you buy this phone, get used to seeing &#34;Unfortunately, &#60;app name&#62; has stopped.&#34; regularly. Loading apps is slow. Running multiple apps isn't advisable. You hit the home button and it takes five seconds to load.<br \/><br \/>Some websites will straight up freeze and become unresponsive in any mobile browser. Others take several seconds to register a swipe to scroll up or down.<br \/><br \/>Swipes frequently register as a tap, which means loading links when you don't mean to. A lot.<br \/><br \/>Playing video is a bit of a stretch. Embedded videos in Instagram would play fine, but anything over 240p on Youtube would stutter badly. If you're lucky you'd get audio but the video would freeze.<br \/><br \/>Data & WiFi Reception:<br \/>WiFi reception sucks. Really sucks. If the WiFi where you are is somewhat iffy, you're not getting a connection. Trying to use anybody's free WiFi is going to turn you into a bitter, angry person. 3G reception is just okay.<br \/><br \/>Call Reception:<br \/>Pretty good, actually. And the speaker is loud enough to make calls in noisier environments.<br \/><br \/>Battery:<br \/>Not bad. Not great. If I charge to full in the morning I can usually wait til evening to charge it again. That's with the screen on for at least a couple of hours reading articles, along with phone calls and texting.<br \/><br \/>Music:<br \/>One of the biggest disappointments. The stock music app will stop randomly, or it will start playing a random song from a different album even if shuffle isn't turned on (my phone seems to love Peter Gabriel's &#34;Passion&#34; album).<br \/><br \/>Google Play music suffers from the random stoppage on this phone as well. My old clamshell Motorola Razor could play music without freezing.<br \/><br \/>Seems to handle Spotify streaming okay though.<br \/><br \/>Additionally, it is REALLY picky about tagging. If anything aside from song name or track number is different from file to file on a single album, it will list them as coming from separate albums.<br \/><br \/>In conclusion, I just don't think the ZTE Valet is really up to providing what most people expect out of an smartphone. Yes, it's exceptionally cheap but that doesn't mean it's a great deal. You get what you pay for. The phone that replaced this was an LG Optimus Fuel that Tracfone was selling for $10 refurbished. MUCH better phone.<br \/><br \/>If all you do is text, call, and check emails, I'm sure the Valet would work fine. Anything else involves mild to moderate frustration.","images":[],"asin":"B00FM7R1WG","parent_asin":"B00FM7R1WG","user_id":"AH2BXZXYSM77FQBYH3YD54BPUTLQ","timestamp":1423160105000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":622,"phone_score":-0.9254155755,"battery_score":-0.9254155755,"screen_score":-0.9254155755,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.9254155755,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.9254155755,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.9254155755,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":-0.9254155755,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9254155755,"wifi_score":-0.9254155755,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Good For A Year Only","text":"After years of buying pricier phones, decided to try Motorola. This phone is my 3rd Moto. I kept upgrading when new model came out. I have had the phone for a year and 1 month now. A week ago I had yet another update wanting to be installed. This is like 3rd one in a year. I'm weary of updates because with Samsung's in the past, once I update, phone would start acting up. Well I did update and now 9 out of 10 incoming calls don't come in. I only know someone tried calling if they left a voicemail or text me to tell me. Texts are even delayed or double sent 9 hours later.<br \/>I'm on T-Mobile, so not sure if it's their issue. My husband has same phone in blue, he sometimes has same issues with calls\/texts. We both noticed after update our batteries do not last as long as they use to and phone runs poorly. I have lost faith in cellphones that actually last. These companies don't build them to last because they just want more money. So I'm at the point where I don't think it matters if you buy an outrageous $1000 phone or spend $200, they are all garbage in a year! I am now on the hunt for a new phone. Before these issues, the phone was good and did what I needed.

On the box says now comes with WhatsApp. Idk if my units can't download it. I tried doing tutorials on Internet but ended up giving up since it's not easy to find if you can or not install it.<br \/><br \/>Now, onto the phone: it's got no t9, nor smart dialing. The earpiece is very low and sometimes the signal gets lost. I use it in Venezuela with Movilnet. I assume it works well with the other two carries we got here. Internet is useless, never use it. The radio is fun to have without having to plug in earphones but then the signal is pretty bad and still needs the earphones to catch on some audible signal sometimes. The camera is pretty good for this short priced model. I'm very surprised by it. The battery is so so. It doesn't last long if you play music for like an hour or if you do three or so long calls up to 10 to 20 minutes each.<br \/><br \/>I like having mine since sometimes I can't use my smartphone on the street or the bus. I can definitively do with this one despite its flaws. But I can certainly recommend a QWERTY model like the samba tv for better user experience.","images":[],"asin":"B00NIEPLHM","parent_asin":"B00NIEPLHM","user_id":"AEBBFPS5REZRKGMNLCV6VB4NW3RQ","timestamp":1436631915000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":235,"phone_score":-0.9085485935,"battery_score":-0.9085485935,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":-0.9085485935,"price_score":-0.9085485935,"phones_score":-0.9085485935,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9085485935,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Be careful about buying Renewed phones.","text":"This particular phone that I purchased was a renewed phone specifically for Verizon which is my carrier. It did not work and I sent it back the next day. The phone would not charge. It recognized that the charger was present, but had the message that it could not charge at this time. Also the phone would not connect to my Verizon network. The SIM card worked on my other Motorola phone but not this one. I spent hours trying to figure out what the problem was and all the phone wanted to do was run diagnostic checks which I had never seen before. Even after the check it still did not work. The phone arrived with 72% battery life and once I had gotten down to about 23% battery life I decided that the phone was just not capable of working. I returned it the next day. Renewed phones are a crap shoot. In some cases they may be a phone that someone had for a day or two and just didn't care for so they returned it, or they can be something where there was some real bad internal damage done and while it looks good on the outside it's a hot mess on the inside. You get what you pay for. I ended up just going to Verizon and bought the Moto 4 from them, it cost $150 more, but since I paid for it in full I am getting $5.38 off a month as a discount which over 24 months is just about $130 so the savings is almost the same and there are no headaches.","images":[],"asin":"B07X4B9G32","parent_asin":"B07X4B9G32","user_id":"AELNCWC52YYB7TS4TM5C6OXQEKEQ","timestamp":1589926454015,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":270,"phone_score":-0.9583067298,"battery_score":-0.9583067298,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.9583067298,"life_score":-0.9583067298,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.9583067298,"case_score":-0.9583067298,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great performance for the money!","text":"My iPhone died recently so my fianc\u00e9 bought me this phone after his boss recommended it. I'm surprised to see how well it works, I use my phone a lot and so far it's been working great for me. The battery will last up to 2 days on one charge if I play games or browse the internet on it a lot; without playing games I can do about 3 days on a single charge. Not as many days as advertised but still better than current high end phones, for such a small price.<br \/><br \/>I had a micro sim card I used with my iPhone and all I had to do was pop the card into this phone to get access to most of the features on my phone plan. The only thing that isn't working right is text messaging, I can't receive pictures in texts and my voicemail-to-text feature doesn't work. I believe there's a fix for these problems, I just haven't got around to fixing it. Overall if you're wondering if you can use a sim card from a previous phone into this one the answer is YES! Just open up the back by carefully taking it off from the small dent in the back cover right above the volume buttons. It's very difficult to take off so you may have to very delicately use a knife or something else to get it off.<br \/><br \/>As far as hardware and software goes, Android performs well enough on this phone. I can play a lot of games on it and they run smoothly. The call quality is great on my end and I've been told it's great on the receiving end too. The default apps on the phone aren't great but with a few functional upgrades from the play store it becomes much easier to use. I won't be using the case that comes with the phone (mostly because it's really ugly lol) but it's nice that it came with one in case I need a backup case. I'm not using the screen protector that came with the phone either because I prefer my matte anti-fingerprint protector but again, it's nice that it came with one.<br \/><br \/>Overall it's a great phone and well worth the price! Obviously if you're looking for something that rivals the specs of the latest iPhone or Galaxy S this phone won't have the processing power you want but for this price it does everything I need it to.","images":[],"asin":"B00SZEFG70","parent_asin":"B00SZEFG70","user_id":"AGXWASK3YESZISIYHQGV3YRFZ7IQ","timestamp":1430285052000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":416,"phone_score":0.7325847149,"battery_score":0.7325846553,"screen_score":0.7325847149,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.7325846553,"phones_score":0.7325847149,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.7325846553,"apps_score":0.7325847149,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.7325846553,"features_score":0.7325847149,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.7325846553,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Curved edges are a dumb idea!","text":"I have the 512GB version and I'm almost on the edge of returning it, but I'll try it for a few more days. The only really annoying problem I find with this phone is on the curved edge it has, making it so that everytime you type something, if your hand or fingers are misplaced then you will automatically touch something in the screen. My case just arrived, it's actually helped but without a case this phone is almost unusable. For such an expensive phone I would have expected any human with a brain would have done tests at Samsung to see if the curved edges actually make sense. I prefer a square edge screen to avoid that problem. But whatevs we'll see. Very disappointed with the design.<br \/><br \/>Edit: Few weeks later update - I was able to get a screen protector, that along with the case has solved or mostly solved the issue with the edge. I'm kind of liking the edge, however no company should ever sacrifice performance through design, and the issues shouldn't have to be solved with or without a screen protector or a case. The battery life could be improved, this phone uses a lot of power, 6,000 mAh could be ideal. The camera could be improved as well, I tried taking a picture of my license the other day and the phone was showing the details on the letters of the license perfectly fine on the screen, but once I took the picture the picture itself wouldn't show perfect details on the letters of the license, I tried in multiple ways with different lighting and the issue continued, I was eventually able to get an ideal license picture after about 20 mins, I believe this issue only happens with close up pictures. Upgraded from a Moto G7 Power the phone is obviously faster and a nice thing I noticed on the speedtest was the internet MBPS DL Speed: on my G7 Power Speedtest would cap at 100 MBPS or so and with the Note 20 Ultra it would cap at 400 MBPS or so. I'm also able to play games with the Note 20 Ultra which is a nice thing.<br \/><br \/>Hopefully Samsung reads this review and improves the phone for next time. I'm still going to keep the 2 Stars because to my understanding these are obvious issues that should have been fixed before shipping the phone. Not giving 1 Star because this phone is much better than my prior old phone.<br \/><br \/>Edit: Changed my stars from 2 to 1. The camera is terrible. It's blurry, it has problems focusing. The camera on my old Motorola G7 Power ($200 phone) is better than the Note 20 Ultra Camera ($1,400 phone).

I had many people tell me to go with samsung but, every review I saw was negative.  This one on the other hand 90% were positive despite never hearing of this brand before. I'm so glad I went with my gut and bought it. I've had it for 2 days now and I love it. The battery lasts all day (I'm a home health nurse and use it a lot to call physicians). When it gets low, it charges so quickly that I never have to worry about it dying. The size makes it easy to fit in my scrub pocket. Even the sound is much better than my LG was. The kids can hear it better to keep them occupied while I'm doing my assessment. I like how this also has a spot for an sd card.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"I would advise against this model. The 2 I've had have screen issues.","text":"This phone worked great for about 6 months and then it became a nightmare!  It started having screen issues after a software update or so it seems as there were no other changes that had been made to the phone. The screen would not come on bright enough to see what was on the phone.  I then contacted Samsung customer service to try to figure out a fix. After trying several different things including clearing cache and even a factory reset it was determined I needed to take it to a repair store.  Huh none exist that will mess with an X Cover Pro so it had to be sent to a Samsung facility in Texas. So after a week without my phone it was sent back and I was told there were no issues found.  Well that is wonderful because upon unboxing my phone and attempting to turn on low and behold, \"Same Issue\". The screen was impossibility dim and it took several minutes of messing with it to get it to come up. (And yes adaptive brightness is turned off) So I was informed by another Samsung tech rep to \"send it in again and have them look at it\" the rep then said if they cannot figure anything out they will send me another phone of the same model. Well thats fair right. Or so I thought because after determining that they were unsure of what was wrong with the phone and I was owed a replacement they told me it would be 15 days before one would be sent out...  Ok, my agitation is growing because after 2 days in shipping and another few days in the facility being looked at combined with the previous sending in I am now without the device for over a month.<br \/><br \/>But we haven't made it to the best part yet... The replacement does the same crap. After about a month it has started doing the same thing. The only thing that changed was another software update and it very well might just be coincidence. Although now I am not so gentle with the phone. I have found that when the issue happens if you smack the phone against your palm it will come on. Sometimes it takes once or twice sometimes more but Samsung wants me to play UPS tag with them again.  Arrrrrg.<br \/>So if I may I would suggest to stay away from the X Cover Pro and find something a bit more common as it is great in theory but failed in use.","images":[],"asin":"B085WTR7BJ","parent_asin":"B085WTR7BJ","user_id":"AFTEIGMNIWAQG2VOFVHC6CEHHCOQ","timestamp":1616468558987,"helpful_vote":12,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":428,"phone_score":-0.9442562461,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.9442564249,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.9442562461,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.9442564249,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9442562461,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"I Love it (See edit)","text":"EDIT:<br \/>Sep 27, 2015<br \/>I have completely thrown out my first initial review, as my first impressions were very quite harsh, too harsh to keep visible, I REALLY should have spent more time with this phone.  The google play store is littered with much better UIs than the factory UI, currently using &#34;Lucid Launcher&#34; and I love it, it has made my experience probably 100x better than first impressions, I may not actually shoot it like i first wanted to.  The phone and OS have become very quite easy to use through learning, trial and error, and full resets, not the best gaming device, get a tablet or more expensive large phone for upper tier gaming, but for simple games like driving and flying simulators, this is great.  I do play ACR racing and it lags here and there, but it really heats up my phone, and it struggles on HD video playback also, especially in fast moving scenes, it'll skip 3 or 4 frames at the worst.<br \/><br \/>Checking all my banking (capital one, first kentucky, and paypal) have become a breeze with using their respective apps and has completely gotten rid of my guessing games I play with my banking, I'm horrible at keeping records of my spending, my wallet ATM book is still blank.  This has made my life so much better, especially with banking, living paycheck to paycheck, you really need to keep an eye on it, and I've been VERY careful, I've already overdrafted once, i'm not gonna do that again.  To stay on topic, I came from an LG 900G, and although this is a budget smartphone, it is an upgrade of up to, if not exceeding 1000 times, in my own perspective.","images":[],"asin":"B0129TQJJU","parent_asin":"B0129TQJJU","user_id":"AFJ5IKWWYBB7ZJTPDYTCLU6KF7UQ","timestamp":1442960348000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":289,"phone_score":0.7513552904,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.7513552904,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.7513552904,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.7513552904,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.7513552904,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Pay as you go best seller!","text":"My best phone ever.  Well, my son says I should have spent another $120 on a newer operating system but I think this 6.0 OS will be supported at least through the life of the phone's battery.  I think Tracfone got it right this time by having the sim card already installed and not having to get it separately.  I have had problems in the past with phone switch over but not this time.  It was a breeze.  Phone battery came 40% charged.  I  put in my extra 32GB sim card and the battery and let it charge while I pulled up my Tracfone account on a computer.  You need to be at a wifi location where you know it's passcode.  After you turn the phone on, it guides you through and uses the internet to set things up. Using wifi it pulled all my old phone apps and settings and Google drive files over from my old phone.  I had stored my old pics and data onto a laptop ahead of time just in case.<br \/>The only thing I did on the Tracfone website was give the new phone's serial number and tell them I wanted to keep the same number.  Left the phone on and waited.  About 15 minutes later the phone chirped and dinged and I had a text saying my phone number was changed over.  The phone through Samsung has a way to geo-locate your phone through their website.  Google also allows you add a voice unlock after you set up the passcode.<br \/>The earpiece and speaker sound is good; pictures and video better than my old phone.  Buttons on my phone are not stiff and work through the OEGO defender case just fine.  I think I will like this OS better once I get used to it.  There are useful apps and I spent the rest of the day playing with setup.  Easy to use.  Even one-handed thumb use is naturally easy.  Much lighter weight and easier to hold than my old phone and same sized screen. Processor speed I would describe as instantaneous.<br \/>I think the J3 Luna is a great value and deserves its place as a best seller for the pay as you go phone user.","images":[],"asin":"B071FBVP5J","parent_asin":"B071FBVP5J","user_id":"AFLYOKQNCKD2YKDAPQK45XZLSGSA","timestamp":1515430847478,"helpful_vote":49,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":374,"phone_score":0.9445143938,"battery_score":0.9445143938,"screen_score":0.9445143938,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.9445143938,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.9445143938,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.9445143938,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9445143938,"wifi_score":0.9445143938,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.9445143938}
{"rating":1.0,"title":"Nice fast phone with a couple of short comings","text":"I've come from using some of the biggest names in the cell phone industry.  When I seen this phone, I read quite a few reviews and decided to try it.  So here's my first impressions of the BLU F91 5G as a daily driver.<br \/><br \/>After unboxing the phone feels of nice quality it doesn't feel cheap.  I really like the Blue color.  After I was able to get everything loaded I was able to really play with this devices settings and check out it's performance.  The screen is nice and makes this phone look more expensive than it really is.  Only 60 hz refresh rate.  Overall, the usual usage of social and media content is good.  I also performed a network speed test on my TMobile network.  I'm seeing about 250 download and about 40 upload, which isn't too bad.  Web pages seem to load as quick as the big name brands.  Call quality is nice and clear.  I believe that this phone doesn't support wifi calling.  So overall at $230 its pretty good.<br \/><br \/> Now, for the short comings.<br \/><br \/>One of my biggest gripes is the audio is a single speaker and it's not the loudest and the sound is a little thin.  It's not terrible but could have been better. On my media player I was able to adjust the EQ to tailor in some better sound which helped a little bit. Stereo speakers here would've really helped this device.  The other short coming of this device is the charging speed.  While in use the phone takes FOREVER to top off from about 60% with the included 18 watt charging brick.  BLU should've upped the charging speed to a minimum of 30 watt charge. Obviously when not in use it will charge faster.  Wireless charging is also included with this phone.  I like the fact that you can set it on the charging pad and got to bed, and it will be fully charged in the morning.  Wifi calling would have been a nice addition.  If Blu would have offered this device with these 3 other options, I believe they would've had a phone that wouldve been at the top of the midrange phones rivaling some flagship devices.<br \/><br \/>In conclusion, the Blu F91 5g is a budget phone that targets midrange phones costing 2 times as much.  The hardware is pretty good for the $$$.  I'm going to make my decision here in the next day or 2 to keep it or return it.  I want to give the device a fair shake.  I'll edit this post if anything else positive or negative come up with the phone.<br \/><br \/>Edit: My Blu f91 data stopped loading web pages.  I went in and reset network settings and that fixed the issue.  Then I had to reset network settings again.  Then again the day after that.  It seems to be a software or hardware issue, so I decided to return the device.  It's a shame, because I had high hopes for the device and I really kinda liked it.  Demoted to 1 star.","images":[],"asin":"B09WJM9XVW","parent_asin":"B09WJM9XVW","user_id":"AHW53RYXSHDHTQQFHRXB67NZZ5RA","timestamp":1664657563850,"helpful_vote":10,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":517,"phone_score":0.8069638014,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.8069638014,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.8069638014,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.8069638014,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.8069638014,"device_score":0.8069638014,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.8069638014,"cell_score":0.8069638014,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"BLU Takes It Up A Notch","text":"Having tested one of BLU's earlier (Studio) cellphone models, I was curious to see how this new model fared. I can honestly say that this phone does not disappoint.<br \/><br \/>Unlike the previous BLU model I tested, the Energy X model has a very solid feel to it. Part of that seems to be due to an improved case that uses a higher grade of plastic. Part is due to a heavier, longer-lasting 4,000 mAh internal battery. Combine that with an even larger 5.5&#34; screen and you have all the ingredients for a phone that looks, feels and operates far beyond any expectations one should have for a cellphone that sells for well under $200.<br \/><br \/>On the plus side, this model's expansive 5.5&#34; display is bright, crisp and very highly responsive. It's quad core processor gives it more than enough juice to stream both audio and video. Resolution-wise, you will not get the same quality picture as an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, but it is quite adequate for viewing the usual content you would normally be watching on a 5.5&#34; screen.<br \/><br \/>The phone's battery performance is great on standby, but drains a bit faster than other phones I have used when running applications. I suspect that the phone's ultra-bright, oversized screen is the main culprit when it comes to battery drain. Fortunately, the phone's internal battery charges up to 4,000 mAh, so you can go longer without recharging than with most phones. The phone's plain-vanilla Android OS is a joy to set up as compared to most phones. You will not find any of the bloatware common to phones you will get directly from your carrier, or even direct from most manufacturers like Samsung. No features are blocked or locked, that includes the ability to tether or operate your phone as a  portable wi-fi hotspot.<br \/><br \/>With all that said, there are obviously some shortcomings with a phone this inexpensive. These mostly fall under the category of &#34;frills&#34; as far as I am concerned, but they may be more important to you. The most obvious shortcoming of this phone is its camera. If you want to record HD video or take high-resolution pictures, this is definitely not the phone for you. It's 8 MP front-facing camera operates slowly and produces sub-par pictures as compared to most modern smartphones. So, don't get your hopes up when it comes to taking pictures.<br \/><br \/>The second most obvious shortcoming is the phone's memory, or lack thereof. 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM don't go a long way if you run a lot of memory intensive apps on your phone. You can add up to 64GB of memory using a micro SD card, but SD cards operate at slower speeds than RAM, so choose your apps (and where you store them) carefully. If you do add a micro SD card for extra memory, be sure to buy a Class 10 card. They may run you a few dollars more, but they seem to run much faster and more reliable than the cheaper Class 4 cards.<br \/><br \/>Another oddball &#34;feature&#34; is the phone's use of removable &#34;cartridges&#34; to store both the micro SD card and the SIM (actually, SIMS, since it holds up to two SIM cards). The phone comes with a tiny &#34;key&#34; you need to use to insert or remove the memory or SIM. You could just as easily use a paperclip, but the fact that these tiny cartridges could become so easily lost or broken while swapping memory or SIM cards is a bit worrisome. If you are the type of person who almost never accesses the SIM or SD card, this should not be an issue. If you swap these frequently, I would stay away from this model though.<br \/><br \/>The last downside I will mention is the phone's battery. While it has great battery life, the inability to swap batteries or quick-charge is a bit of a disappointment. I think that BLU went the wrong direction in making the battery non-swappable, but I'm guessing that accounts for how they kept the price of the phone so low.<br \/><br \/>Altogether, this is an impressive looking phone with an easy to read screen, tons of features and plenty of battery life. While it does not measure up to an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy when it comes to specs, what you do get for the price is pretty awesome. With an unlocked GSM smartphone with dual SIMS, quad core processor and 5.5&#34; display for under $200 you can hardly go wrong.","images":[],"asin":"B0129TQLPW","parent_asin":"B0129TQLPW","user_id":"AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA","timestamp":1440924607000,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":763,"phone_score":0.9743326902,"battery_score":0.9743326902,"screen_score":0.9743326902,"camera_score":0.9743326902,"price_score":0.9743326902,"phones_score":0.9743326902,"life_score":0.9743326902,"quality_score":0.9743326902,"apps_score":0.9743326902,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.9743326902,"case_score":0.9743326902,"features_score":0.9743326902,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.9743326902,"app_score":0.9743326902,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.9743326902,"size_score":0.9743326902}

I'm not sure what the reason could be, but my fingerprints on the screen look as if I had grease on my hands, and very smudgy!  I had the Samsung S9 for five years prior to this phone, and I kept the screen clean with alcohol wipes, but when I try it with this phone, it just smears more, never gets clean\/clear, and the screen just seems like a different kind of glass than what is normally on phones.  Also, I can see a two inch long horizontal line of what looks like a streak of water under the screen about an inch from the top, and it's visible all the time, so for that reason, and the issue with the screen, I'm not sure yet if I will keep this phone.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Avoid","text":"First, I want to mention that this is review is not a reflection of the seller in any way. I purchased the phone through T-Mobile which the only carrier for this phone. None of the reviews I saw mentioned the troubles I've discovered, so I wanted to ensure this information was put out to other potential buyers, though I suspect there won't be many more given that T-Mobile seems to have stopped selling this phone.<br \/><br \/>Toughness: I've had the phone for around 9 months and have had no problems, except one - the front screen broke. This is not the touch-screen, but the screen that is on the top of the closed phone. It has a *glass* cover over it. For a phone built with construction workers in mind, using a glass screen is one massive face-palm of a mistake.<br \/><br \/>Battery: I don't use my phone excessively - one of the reasons I wanted a simple flip phone to begin with - so I can't say everyone will be happy, but it seems like it has decent life. I usually only charge it once every few days, but, again, that's with minimal use.<br \/><br \/>Calling \/ Texting: Work fine, except for the problems listed below (not being able to use the physical buttons and touch screen being too small).<br \/><br \/>Touch Screen \/ Buttons: The other big reason I wanted a flip phone was because I didn't want it to do much more than text and call, but the thought of possibly using google maps with this phone was enticing.<br \/>  1) The physical buttons can't reliably be used. A single press often results in multiple entries; if I press the \"6\" button, there's a very good chance it will input \"66\".<br \/>  2) The touch screen is too small to be used reliably. I often have to poke the same spot several times to achieve what I want.<br \/>  3) Google maps is entirely unusable with a screen so small. All the extra buttons Google Maps adds to the interface means you only get about 1 third of the actual screen size, which is already very small.","images":[],"asin":"B0BTTQGVVW","parent_asin":"B0BTTQGVVW","user_id":"AGDTSZN4O4T5HJNENHDAUCKPNJ2A","timestamp":1679668681568,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":360,"phone_score":0.51049757,"battery_score":0.51049757,"screen_score":0.51049757,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.51049757,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.51049757,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.51049757,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.51049757}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Best value device. I love it","text":"I am who you would consider a pro user. I make apps for both iOS and Android and fully understand both the inner and outer workings of electronic devices such as smart phones. This phone is hands down the best device you can get for the price at the time of this review.<br \/>It doesn't have the best screen, camera or chipset but you'd be hard pressed to find another phone that offers close to what this one offers given the price. So what are you looking for in a smart phone? I would say a great screen, solid battery life, NFC for mobile payments, Good cameras, Quality design and Intuitive operation system and smooth performance. This phone checks all the boxes. The screen resolution is 1080+ meaning it's just slightly higher in resolution than your standards FHD so text and images will appear bright, sharp and vibrant. The screen also supports a 120hz refresh rate just like those $1,000+ phones. The battery is BIG with over 5000mah battery cell this phone will last you 2 days on normal usage and 1 day if you're like me, a power user. But doesn't matter it will charge to 100% in little over 1 hr. Are you accustomed to mobile pay? Don't worry Google pay works here too. Design wise; it's a pretty standard design not ugly but I am not too much a fan of the camera layout on the back. The back is also plastic but feels good. And to be honest personally I prefer a plastic back as it's more durable than glass. The screen is covered with gorilla glass 6 which has excellent drop resistance. I've dropped mine about 3 times now and not a single scratch was found but still I would recommend keeping the plastic case that comes in the box on it until you purchase another one. Something else to point out is that this phone comes with a ir blaster so you can use it to control your TV and so on. Lastly, we have the camera and chipset. Camera is solid my sister as the s22 ultra and shots are identically in proper lighting. The s22 ultra shines when it comes on to HDR and detail though but to be honest I wouldn't care which camera I grabbed to go shoot because the difference isn't mind blowing. In the video depart this phone keeps up by offering 4k 30fps and other shooting modes like slow mo 240fps 1080p and some cool camera apps that make you shoot awesome B-rolls. For extras the phone as dual loud speakers. Side mounted finger print scanner. Can use two sims or 1 sim plus sd card upto about 512g *I think. Haptic feedback is good but not iphone level. Front camera is idk I don't use it. Volume buttons are clicky but not the best feeling. Supports the headphone jack. And runs on MIUI for POCO which is a good skin that tries to be like iOS current version 12.5 not sure if this phone will receive the new MIUI 13 update. Which is based on Android 12. The chipset is the snapdragon 860 and mine as 8 gigabytes of ram. Basically the phone is very fast and will play any game available at the highest settings. All that for under $300 come on no way an iPhone or a Samsung flagship as to cost over a thousand dollars. I recommend this phone.","images":[],"asin":"B0919LWHVK","parent_asin":"B0919LWHVK","user_id":"AGYEEKNWANXHURKY2ETBOGYN5PHQ","timestamp":1645365233654,"helpful_vote":5,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":576,"phone_score":0.806460917,"battery_score":0.806460917,"screen_score":0.806460917,"camera_score":0.806460917,"price_score":0.806460917,"phones_score":0.806460917,"life_score":0.806460917,"quality_score":0.806460917,"apps_score":0.806460917,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.806460917,"case_score":0.806460917,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.806460917,"device_score":0.8064608574,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.8064608574,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.8064608574,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"A very specific phone for a very specific use case","text":"First off... I was trying to find an unlocked feature phone for under $100 that would run a Ting V1 SIM card (AKA Ting's MVNO spin of the Verizon network) in December 2020. This was the ONLY phone I could find that fit that bill. Hopefully that changes before long... but it's worth noting that it DID take the Ting V1 SIM and rocked it quite well. It would probably also work for StraightTalk and other Verizon resellers. This is no small thing...<br \/><br \/>However... the feature phone was for my 72 y.o. mother. For that use case, it TOTALLY didn't work out. At all. The phone runs a cut-down version of Android rebranded \"MyOS\". My mom is a major league luddite and COULD NOT work out how to use the Contacts stored in her phone. (Didn't help that I was trying to do this with her socially distanced, but a few masked meetings and carefully written out instruction sheets *still* didn't help.) It was far too easy for her to accidentally start EDITING a contact instead of calling one, which was SUCH crap design. Further, while it is a version of Android, I couldn't [1] disable entire apps (as my mom DESPISES texting and always insists I disable voicemail, texting, AND data on every phone), [2] install new apps, [3] use low-level hacking facilities like 'adb', nor [4] rearrange the layout of the launcher screen. Getting my mother to get used to drilling down through the lock screen over to the Contacts app, down through the list, and down to the specific phone number was asking too much. Further, the phone allows you to interact with the notifications area. Let me repeat that... a flip phone with a top line notifications area. That is just a fail. That damned notifications area confused the crap out of Mom. And it's mapped right to one of the top two navigation buttons. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Far better would have been if they'd mapped \"Contacts\" instead of \"Notification\". And I must say, in my own limited time with the phone, while I COULD use it, I really didn't enjoy the experience. The bottom line is that you really need to be quite familiar with Android already to use this phone effectively, but you're still going to need to adjust to all the very weird ways Android was then adapted to be the core of a feature phone. I'm going to try to replace this phone with a Jethro SC490; it's also based on Android, but the adaptation to a feature phone seems to have gone WAY better; unfortunately, I'll need to swap Mom to an Ting X3 SIM, which will crap out when she's visiting my brother out of town. But there was simply no way to get her a phone on a Ting V1 SIM that she could actually use. The old 3G phones are now dead; this could replace them, but only if you're willing to fight with it a little and already know what you're doing.<br \/><br \/>So, the use case here is for somebody who wants an unlocked feature phone that can run on the Verizon network; may appreciate the ability to link to Google services, Facebook, and WhatsApp (all things I avoid); and would find a chopped down Android charming in spite of its quirks. I'm thinking this is for preteens on a short leash, middle aged people trying to reduce their screen addiction (but still want the ungodsly hell of Facebook?), or for anybody who really wants something without a touch screen that can still run Facebook or WhatsApp. It's an oddball device. It'll probably have more of a market when it finally drops under $30. Currently, at nearly $80 with tax, I honestly found it overpriced.","images":[],"asin":"B0858QDP5C","parent_asin":"B0858QDP5C","user_id":"AHGZQEHDUTUPVXYIGWS6KDZBFO5Q","timestamp":1609477061237,"helpful_vote":17,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":628,"phone_score":0.8692919016,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.8692919016,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.8692919016,"phones_score":0.8692919016,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.8692919016,"service_score":0.8692919016,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.8692919016,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.8692919016,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.8692919016,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

If I keep my phone in my pocket (particularly one close-ish to my body), I have no problems.  If I keep it in an outer coat pocket --  let alone use it outside for more than 10 mins without actually being on a call -- in 35 degrees or lower, the screen locks up, entirely.

As I was setting up the phone I forgot about that thinking it was about 5G being so fast and it smokes with Tmobile but not with ATT.","images":[],"asin":"B07CHWQB1C","parent_asin":"B07CHWQB1C","user_id":"AETXRS5F6JDSKBCWH4HXXYUQKSRQ","timestamp":1530259893945,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":126,"phone_score":0.9140649438,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.9140649438,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.9140649438,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.9140649438,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Curb your enthusiasm and expections.","text":"Let me start by saying, with all of its shortcomings I'm about to say, I am comparing this to the Iphone SE from 2016. This phone is relevant and in many ways better than Iphone SE, but loses in some areas.<br \/><br \/>The camera vs. Iphone SE, if you have light, and time to focus, sure it rivals the Iphone SE. Iphone SE however does great in most situations and can capture motion, Iphone SE is just a better camera, thats all there is to it. I'd say the photos can lose up seventy percent of its focus even on paper text sheets if you do not focus correctly on the paperwork! That said, it seems to function ok with sunlight.<br \/><br \/>This leads to the second thing that makes Iphone SE superior, the screen itself. We should curb expectations and remember this is a 150$ phone, so there are going to be shortcuts.  So the screen is quite crisp and response, and it can even play mild games like League of Legends WildRift at acceptable quality. It just falls so hard and fails so bad in sunlight! The screen simply cannot get bright enough in direct sunlight. This really kills the ability to read unless you can find some shade. This just sucks.<br \/><br \/>The amazing part is battery life, Its been 5 months now, and its solid, like heavy and long lasting. The phone truly can sit idle for days. Can be used for an alittle bit each day and be charged in 4-5 days. If your face is glued to the phone, then go seek help!<br \/><br \/>That leads to the other problem with the phone, IT really is too heavy. The phone is definitely more durable to abuse then iphone SE, but the weight of the phone itself means that this point is null, one bad angle drop on an edge and its all over. Mine is cracked after a three foot drop. Still seems to be fairly water proof with crack somehow, but now I cannot say in good faith its still a good idea to push this phones limit.<br \/><br \/>Loading apps on this quad core is not always faster than the Iphone SE, but its certainly more reliable, does not crash often, does not overheat in sunlight due to its natural thermal mass. It vs iphone SE hands down has supieror signal strength, getting coverage where Iphone SE thinks is a deadspot. This phone at the end of the day, is a fantastic phone, and appears to be better at the primary task at hand.<br \/><br \/>I think this would be a great phone for a young adult with tight budget, or for older people who just needs primary task of being a phone as clear objective without garbage loaded up on the phone. I am happy to use this phone for another year or two and believe this is a good deal.<br \/><br \/>That said, durability and camera quality may be misleading. And as someone coming from a company that lied and nerfed their batteries life for their iphones, even with this supposed slow charger, this is a huge step up from dedicated charging lifestyle at every potential part of the day.","images":[],"asin":"B082XPD4L6","parent_asin":"B082XPD4L6","user_id":"AEX7RRCIGXTECQJE5B3LNCBWNX5A","timestamp":1619717602899,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":540,"phone_score":-0.7454527617,"battery_score":-0.7454527617,"screen_score":-0.7454527617,"camera_score":-0.7454527617,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.7454527617,"life_score":-0.7454527617,"quality_score":-0.7454527617,"apps_score":-0.7454527617,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.7454527617,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.7454527617,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

The 6GB of RAM shows with how smoothly it runs, the screen looks great, and, while I would prefer it to have an actual headphone port, other than that, the form factor is nice. Unfortunately, I bought it to use on Verizon, since it was advertised as working on Verizon as well as other carriers, and apparently BLU did not put an antenna into the phone capable of actually picking up a usable Verizon signal. It does NOT give an error that indicates the SIM card is invalid or anything like that, so I think it's set up with the software necessary to recognize a Verizon SIM. There are just no bars. Putting the exact same SIM into my old phone in the same exact location in my house yields several bars. The BLU VIVO XI+ gets none.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Close, but no cigar","text":"I was excited to get the Unihertz Titan Slim as T-Mobile no longer supports the BlackBerry Key 2 phone. The Titan Slim is the closest thing to the Key 2, but be warned:<br \/><br \/>The Titan Slim is anything but slim. It is a fat hunk of phone, double the thickness of the BlackBerry. The only thing slim about it is the screen is not as wide as the BlackBerry.<br \/><br \/>At the bottom of the screen, where nearly every other phone on the market would let you select Back, Home, and Open Apps, there is nothing but 1\/4 inch of black glass. To go back, you have to either use the Back button which is on the top row of the keyboard, right next to the Home Button\/fingerprint reader, which means if you miss the Back button and accidentally hit the Home Button, the screen collapses. The other way is to set up the screen so a flick from the right or left of the screen acts as the Back button. The problem with this is you will invariably flick when you don't mean to flick.<br \/><br \/>But let's get to the real problem: the kludgy keyboard.  If you are like me and have touch capacitance issues, a keyboard is a must (In fact, I'm surprised the Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't help people with touch capacitance issues, but that's something for Congress to figure out). The Titan Slim keyboard sucks. I mean, it really sucks!<br \/><br \/>The SHIFT button is at the top left of the keyboard in a location that makes no sense. The ALT button is at the top right which makes selecting ( . , or any ALT icon on the right side of the keyboard difficult). The space bar is placed in the middle of the bottom row between the letters ZXCV and BNM. Here's the problem with this:  after years of using keyboards with the space bar below these letters, every time you try to type N, you'll hit B and every time you try to type M, you'll press N. With all the wasted space on the bottom of the screen, Unihertz should have put the following keys at the bottom, under the letters:  SHIFT, SYM, SPACE, ALT, RETURN. That would make this phone usable for work, but as it is, you're better off doing any serious typing via your computer by hooking up the computer and phone via software like Wondershare MirrorGo (itself, slow).<br \/><br \/>Next issue: No returns. As stated on the Unihertz site, if you buy the phone, you cannot return it unless you cancel your order while they are processing your order. This is ridiculous.<br \/><br \/>The facial recognition looks for you whenever movement is sensed and I've noticed leaving the phone on a table or car's cup holder or in your pocket will activate the facial recognition which then gets repeated false readings and you then have to use your pass code to unlock the phone. For some reason, pressing the power button does darken the screen, but it doesn't stop facial recognition from continuing to look for a face.<br \/><br \/>The good things about the Titan Slim, and yes, there are a few:  battery life so far is excellent with a full-day's charge easily obtained. The small screen is clear and easy to read. The audio is good, not great, merely good. The phone comes with a rubber side and back case, which provides good grip. I attached a Lovehandle Phone Grip to the case and it makes holding the thick phone pretty good, but dang this phone is thick. It's so thick it won't sit in the phone cradle that works great with anything from BlackBerry, Samsung, Apple, Nokia, and Google. How thick is it? A BlackBerry Key 2 is 3\/16 inch thick; the Titan Slim is 1\/2 inch--that's 8\/16--thick. It should have been named the Titan Tank.<br \/><br \/>One last thing: be prepared to be laughed at when you set the Titan Slim down on a table. Most everybody I have seen since getting the phone calls it a \"brick\" or \"something from the 80s\". They literally think it's a joke and can't believe I'd carry such a thick phone around.<br \/><br \/>I sure miss BlackBerry and had high hopes OnwardMobility was going to introduce a BlackBerry 5G with keyboard but that company is out of business and it appears BlackBerry (RIM) sold off the core BlackBerry technology--which was the most secure for corporate users--Huawei has acquired 90 patents from Blackberry.","images":[],"asin":"B0841HHLT9","parent_asin":"B0841HHLT9","user_id":"AE4VISQS5LSOJAFP7PUCASMFJIWA","timestamp":1661574968075,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":757,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"My Moto X Pure Edition was great, but had issues with bluetooth and picture messages","text":"What an incredible value!  After having a string of reliable phones, I've bounced between a few in the last year-plus.  My Moto X Pure Edition was great, but had issues with bluetooth and picture messages, and the Nexus 5X that followed had a charging port that failed twice.<br \/><br \/>So, based on the positive reputation of the G series and the strong early reviews, I decided to take a chance on the G5+.<br \/><br \/>Performance seemed a little bumpy at first, but as the phone got things cached it became astoundingly fast, especially at this price point.  I'm sure having 4GB of RAM has something to do with that, and it was definitely worth the extra money.  By that same token, the 64GB internal storage is very impressive for a phone at this price point, especially when it also supports SD cards.<br \/><br \/>Oh, and a note on battery life - It's incredible.  I work in a profession that prevents me from using my phone much, but even if I have 1-2 hours screen time I still end the day (16 hours off charge) with 70% or more.  If I'm working long hours, I'm convinced I could get 4 days out of this thing.  Left off the charger overnight for 8 hours, it only loses 2-3% charge.  On non-work days, when I'm on it a lot more, I've only barely managed to put it below 50%.  Truly worry-free, and the included Turbo Power charger works as advertised.<br \/><br \/>The fingerprint sensor is very good as well.  It's on the bottom bezel of the phone, which isn't necessarily ideal - I loved the sensor on the back of the Nexus 5X - but it's fast, works as an on-off switch, and can be used to replace on-screen controls - swipe left to go back, swipe right to show recent apps, and tap to go to the home screen.  Long press to lock.  I played with this a bit, and it seems to work reliably as intended.<br \/><br \/>Honestly, the worst features are the slightly-slick metal body and the new moto logo on the upper bezel, which looks silly.  Motorola has built a reputation of making phones unadorned with branding of any sort, short of their logo on the back, and this bit just reminds me of ugly Verizon Droid brandings of the past.<br \/><br \/>I long for the curved backs of the X series, but it's a minor complaint.  If you need a phone that is quick and responsive, has a great-looking screen, runs Android 7.0, you could break the bank.  Or, you could buy the Moto G5+ for $299.","images":[],"asin":"B01MR2ZFBI","parent_asin":"B01MR2ZFBI","user_id":"AEYU434AGT62ZUDI6IPKIFMQVQNA","timestamp":1494840274000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":439,"phone_score":0.843274653,"battery_score":0.843274653,"screen_score":0.843274653,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.843274653,"phones_score":0.843274653,"life_score":0.843274653,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.843274653,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.843274653,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.843274653,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.843274653,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I HATE this crappy phone and am super upset to lose the $115 I paid for it.","images":[],"asin":"B017HW9DEW","parent_asin":"B017HW9DEW","user_id":"AEANYFBEUPF32J35MAWG2IV5QR5Q","timestamp":1469137623000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":85,"phone_score":-0.9927605391,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9751048684,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Centro Rocks and Sprint Service is Doable","text":"This phone is excellent--you wanted smaller, you're going to get less battery life and a bit of a cramped keyboard--take it or leave it.  It's fast, it does everything you ask it to, and I've loaded over 120 applications on mine without issues (except for my cheap 2gb micro sd card not mounting--easily taken care of using Safeguard software).<br \/><br \/>I was a Sanyo loyalist.  But I had always wanted a smart phone.  Walked through wal mart one day and said, \"No I'm just browsing,\" when the guy, who I had bought my last cell from a year earlier (katana II), asked if he could help me.  Then I saw the price tag: $48.  I was all over it (2 year extension required).<br \/><br \/>Regarding customer service--Sprint doesn't rank at the top, but you WILL get what you ask for if you are patient.  If you want immediate answers from some really sharp technical people, use their e-mail support option.  I've been with Sprint for 5 years and have never had problems with service, up and down the east coast, not to mention they gave me a 14% discount on my plan just for being a veteran (only applies to monthly recurring charge, or MRC, not add-ons).<br \/><br \/>I don't necessarily doubt that these 1-star reviews are legitimate, but it surprises me, considering I used to sell Sprint and Verizon cell phones and we rarely had complaints about Sprint.  My advice to the people that are freaking out is this--if your phone isn't functioning properly, and you know it isn't something you did, see if it's in warranty and deal with Palm directly.  If it is something Sprint did (perhaps loading a facebook app, for example) then you need to get in touch with sprint.  If you don't like the result, use the e-mail support option.  If you don't like that result, call and demand a supervisor, and write his\/her name down in case you are disconnected (it all goes into the computer on their end).  You WILL get what you need.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Very Solid Phone, until it suddenly stopped working","text":"First off this phone is very big, bulky and heavy. I expected that when I ordered this phone and I think my expectations were exceeded! However, this is the reason this phone is also solid and built to last. It's still able to fit in the front pocket of my Levis 501s but it's tight.<br \/><br \/>I played with the phone all weekend, putting it on my wireless charger and connecting USB to my truck a few times and never did the battery dip below upper 80%. There's very little bloatware so this straight Android Oreo OS flows very smooth, switching between games, social media and my Nest Cams with ease. The screen is clear and bright and very responsive. I think the coolest feature is the fingerprint reader on the middle of the right side of the phone. Even with the screen off and the phone locked, the fingerprint reader unlocks the phone in less than a second. There's a dedicated quick launch button below the fingerprint sensor, however I haven't figured out how set that up yet. Seems like the button would be prone to pocket pushes\/ false pushes since they are pretty easy to press.<br \/><br \/>My biggest complaint and the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5, is the camera. I'm upgrading to this phone from the Samsung S6 Active which I thought had a great camera. On paper the BV9500 should be much better, however, the few pics I've taken were grainy and not very clear. I hope there's something I can do to improve the camera quality because I was planing on using this phone long term. A crappy camera might be a deal breaker though.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I'm initially pleased and I'd recommend this phone to someone looking for a rugged phone with superb battery life, excellent performance with a subpar camera.<br \/><br \/>*Update*<br \/>Well on March 8th 2019,  four months after I got it, in the middle of typing a text message,  the screen stopped reacting to touch. I did a reboot and since I can't input the security pattern,  I'm basically stuck with a brick. Of course the return window has just closed, I'm hoping the vendor will step up and make it right.  This phone has been  gently used so this failure was unprovoked.","images":[],"asin":"B07GDR6NJ8","parent_asin":"B07GDR6NJ8","user_id":"AFQIHDENQP7Q4E43TZMOPYIRL3LQ","timestamp":1540827354304,"helpful_vote":21,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":385,"phone_score":-0.6626117826,"battery_score":-0.6626117826,"screen_score":-0.6626117826,"camera_score":-0.6626117826,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":-0.6626117826,"quality_score":-0.6626117826,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.6626117826,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.6626117826,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":-0.6626117826,"size_score":0.0}

So easy a caveman could do it! (That's me!)  Camera is outstanding.  Speed on the 5G was giving me over 200Mbps on downloads and over 40 Mbps on uploads.  Screaming!  I paired this up with a Zizo Bolt case and it looks great and is protected pretty well.  If I did have one thing I don't like about it is the placement of the on\/off button that is mid way down on the right side below the volume up\/down buttons.

If you just want to watch video on a huge screen then this is not.<br \/>One thing LG can improve on this phone is adding the Face Unlocked option, i hate the built in fingerprint as it's only works 80% of the time.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Goodbye MDA, It's been an experience","text":"We've been together for two years.  We both knew our relationship was dysfunctional and temporary, but it took this long for me to find something new and better.  For two grueling years I put up with all of my MDA's quirks, crashes, and severe lack of performance.<br \/><br \/>  I was initially impressed by the MDA's long list of features, but in practice my MDA has been anything but useful.  Sure this device can do anything, but it does absolutely nothing well.  Windows occasionally froze in the middle of phone calls, apps crash, the screen took too long to readjust when I slid out the keyboard, the speakerphone with its loud yet poor quality sound, and dialing phone numbers was much more difficult than it should have been.  I had to educate myself in the inner workings of the Windows Mobile platform, overclocking and editing registry settings, just to be able to use the device.<br \/><br \/>The only reason I stayed in this abusive relationship was because I couldn't find anything with equal features.  The last thing I wanted to do was downgrade to a cheap razr, even if it meant putting up with so much daily frustration.  Today marks the end of our relationship.  I found something stable, sleeker, more powerful, more capable and better designed: The Blackberry Curve 8320.<br \/><br \/>Goodbye MDA.  We've had an interesting run.

I called Tracfone and they set up everything and I kept my old number too.","images":[],"asin":"B083KNW4GW","parent_asin":"B083KNW4GW","user_id":"AGLFLIQRFOIBUFM3Y35XGQLJ4POQ","timestamp":1600051818886,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":102,"phone_score":0.9226170778,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.9804651737,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9882962108,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"I wish they did more testing...","text":"The hardware works, I haven't had any problems with that yet. The software, however, is terrible in some places, or just doesn't work in others.<br \/><br \/>First annoyance: the touch screen. There's a button on the left side of the phone that \"locks\" the screen. This means that the screen dims and changes to a different page, showing you the time and including an unlock button at the bottom left. After about 4 seconds, the screen turns off. If, at any time, for any reason, the phone receives an alert (hey! that message you just sent was sent!), the touch screen is touched by your pockets (it always happens), or one of the potruding buttons are pushed, the phone either delays the screen shutoff, turns back on the screen, or completely unlocks your phone, calling your mother as soon as it can. I fix this by sending a message, waiting for it to tell me I sent a message, locking the phone, staring at it until the screen goes off, and gently sliding my phone in my pocket like the phone was made of paper.<br \/><br \/>Second annoyance: the messaging system. There's a few quirks with this, but only one of them really gets me. I text special characters, such as a \"&lt;\" or \">\" to make pictures, as some people do. If I'm texted and want to reply with one of these, well, I can't. The \"Sym\" button does not work. Yes, the pantech laser has a button that DOES NOT WORK. The thing is, instead of just typing a reply, I have to open the message within the conversation we've been having, click \"Options\" and hit \"reply\". Then I can use the button. Or, if I'm really in a rush, I can use the touchscreen to browse the symbols (past the common ones like \",\" or \".\" because they're important!) several pages in to find my one character, and then keep typing. It basically makes replying about 7 times longer than it needs to be.<br \/><br \/>You can read the other reviews for the other shortfalls this phone has.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"It lasted almost two years","text":"Update 9\/14\/20<br \/>I really enjoyed this phone. I thought it would last much longer than it did since I always had it in a holster and rarely ever dropped it. Suddenly on 9\/3\/20 the phone started displaying white vertical lines. I could still use the phone but I knew its days were numbered. My last Asus phone lasted about two years also. I immediately purchased a new phone and started configuring it. On 9\/14\/20 the zenfone 4 phone became unusable as the white lines got worse and the screen images started shaking. This phone didn't even last two years. At least my old zenfone 2 is still usable.<br \/><br \/>Update 3\/12\/19<br \/>ASUS support reached out to me and, after determining that I qualified for a replacement, sent me another Zenfone 4. It is refurbished but it looked brand new and I have not experienced a problem with it yet. I am changing my rating to 4 stars.<br \/><br \/>Original review:<br \/>I owned a zenfone 2 for three years without any issues. The phone still works but I wanted an upgrade. I purchased the zenfone 4 after Thanksgiving 2018 and I may need to return it in less than a month. I am very disappointed. The phone is fast and the battery life is outstanding. The speaker is good and the Bluetooth has a better range than my zenfone 2.  The problem that I started experiencing is that apps stopped opening sporadically. Whichever app that I was using would close immediately on its own and the phone switches to the home screen. I actually select an app, it starts to open but closes instead. This goes on and on until I give up and put the phone away for a while. I researched this, applied all of the updates which now has my phone at Android 8 but the problem still occurs.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fantastic value for the price","text":"Update 5-15-2019: As of this posting this phone WILL NOT work on Total Wireless.  All of the necessary bands are there but Total Wireless does not support it.  This might change in the future.  The phone DOES work on official Verizon service with a Verizon SIM without an issue, as long as the SIM is already activated.  As I use the phone more I come across various software glitches, translation mistakes and other oddities in menus.  None of them have made the phone unusable or less for it's value.<br \/><br \/>First off it should be known that this is NOT a $1000 phone.  If you go into this expecting that you will be disappointed.  What this phone is, is a $220 winner.  I was hesitant to purchase this phone from a relatively unknown brand, at least to me.  I did a lot of research and came across them by accident and boy oh boy am I glad that I did.  I have been an avid user of the Moto G line for several years, but the newest Moto G 7 did not impress me.  I have been wanting NFC in a budget line device for several years, and year after year Moto has let me down.  This is a solid mid range phone for less than the price of the Moto G 7.  It is built very well and looks far more expensive than it is, it will impress.<br \/><br \/>The phone came with US fast charger, USB cord, simple silicone case, and screen protector already installed.  The screen is beautiful and bright taking up the most of the front of the device.  The blacks are very dark almost tricking you into thinking it is OLED, it isn't.  The screen was bright enough for use in the sun.  The adaptive brightness works well where it really didn't on my last phone.  The fingerprint reader on the back is sometimes finicky, but I have started using the face unlock without much of a problem.  It could be how I am holding it.  It would make more sense for it to be lower on the phone.  I have smaller hands and a larger phone is always a challenge for me.  The camera is not a $1000 camera, but it takes respectful pictures in good light.  I have not tried it in low light yet, but I assume that the pictures will be washed out and underexposed which should be expected.  The daylight photos were crisp and the depth sensor was doing it's job.  The software experience is mostly stock Android which makes it snappy and responsive.  There are a few software additions and subtractions thrown in by Umidigi.  The phone only has a single down firing speaker which was sort of quiet for my liking.  If you hold the phone just right you can direct it back at your ear which helps a lot.  The sound is somewhat hollow and echoey as well.  The earpiece was quiet by comparison to some other phones which may make it a bit hard to hear in a loud environment.  The processor, for being a couple of generations old, is very snappy and shows little lag.  Out of the box half of the ram was being used which is something typical with new Android phones, so 6 GB should be the standard.  There is some stutter and lag from time to time, but hey its a $220 phone.  It is perfectly fine for the price point and daily use.  I can verify that this phone works flawlessly on Verizon, but did not have to call them to activate.  I just popped an unlocked SIM in the phone.  WIFI calling worked fine for me on Verizon and call quality was no issue.  Battery life is fantastic.  Playing with the settings and restoring an update of my old phone took about 20% of the life over the course of 4 or 5 hours.<br \/><br \/>If I had to list a con it would be that sometimes I notice the screen flicker when adjusting to ambient light, but I really don't care for the price.  You have to stare and know it is there to see it.<br \/><br \/>I would not hesitate to pick the phone up again and will for sure look at Umidigi in the future when looking for a good deal.  Nice work!","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51yCjKeB-yL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51yCjKeB-yL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51yCjKeB-yL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61WE9JC6iOL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61WE9JC6iOL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61WE9JC6iOL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u6QWfCdQL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u6QWfCdQL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u6QWfCdQL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7102uHoSzfL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7102uHoSzfL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7102uHoSzfL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7119E8lhJ5L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7119E8lhJ5L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7119E8lhJ5L.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JyMoCJBNL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JyMoCJBNL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71JyMoCJBNL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71MrO7oh6WL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71MrO7oh6WL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71MrO7oh6WL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71aTTZp71zL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71aTTZp71zL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71aTTZp71zL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71cPEbhwFVL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71cPEbhwFVL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71cPEbhwFVL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B07NTBFG1D","parent_asin":"B07NTBFG1D","user_id":"AEASCQELXDO4FHFLFSZW7MBBIVKA","timestamp":1557894187861,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":727,"phone_score":-0.8000663519,"battery_score":-0.8000663519,"screen_score":-0.8000663519,"camera_score":-0.8000663519,"price_score":-0.8000663519,"phones_score":-0.8000663519,"life_score":-0.8000663519,"quality_score":-0.8000663519,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.8000663519,"battery life_score":-0.8000663519,"case_score":-0.8000663519,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.8000663519,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.8000663519,"wifi_score":-0.8000663519,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Avoid","text":"First, I want to mention that this is review is not a reflection of the seller in any way. I purchased the phone through T-Mobile which the only carrier for this phone. None of the reviews I saw mentioned the troubles I've discovered, so I wanted to ensure this information was put out to other potential buyers, though I suspect there won't be many more given that T-Mobile seems to have stopped selling this phone.<br \/><br \/>Toughness: I've had the phone for around 9 months and have had no problems, except one - the front screen broke. This is not the touch-screen, but the screen that is on the top of the closed phone. It has a *glass* cover over it. For a phone built with construction workers in mind, using a glass screen is one massive face-palm of a mistake.<br \/><br \/>Battery: I don't use my phone excessively - one of the reasons I wanted a simple flip phone to begin with - so I can't say everyone will be happy, but it seems like it has decent life. I usually only charge it once every few days, but, again, that's with minimal use.<br \/><br \/>Calling \/ Texting: Work fine, except for the problems listed below (not being able to use the physical buttons and touch screen being too small).<br \/><br \/>Touch Screen \/ Buttons: The other big reason I wanted a flip phone was because I didn't want it to do much more than text and call, but the thought of possibly using google maps with this phone was enticing.<br \/>  1) The physical buttons can't reliably be used. A single press often results in multiple entries; if I press the \"6\" button, there's a very good chance it will input \"66\".<br \/>  2) The touch screen is too small to be used reliably. I often have to poke the same spot several times to achieve what I want.<br \/>  3) Google maps is entirely unusable with a screen so small. All the extra buttons Google Maps adds to the interface means you only get about 1 third of the actual screen size, which is already very small.","images":[],"asin":"B0BTTTXP6M","parent_asin":"B0BTTTXP6M","user_id":"AGDTSZN4O4T5HJNENHDAUCKPNJ2A","timestamp":1679668648107,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":360,"phone_score":0.51049757,"battery_score":0.51049757,"screen_score":0.51049757,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.51049757,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.51049757,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.51049757,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.51049757}

Guess what..  :-(<br \/>Otherwise seems to be a nice phone.","images":[],"asin":"B00EN6D8H4","parent_asin":"B00EN6D8H4","user_id":"AFUGXYCKH5ATA4O5Z2EDV3EGOFJA","timestamp":1387470764000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":74,"phone_score":0.6726006269,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great except for Camera","text":"At this price everything about this phone is great except for the camera. I didn't expect a great 8mp camera but I did expect it to perform as well as my aging Galaxy S3 8mp camera. It is worse. Colors, clarity and low light level performance is poor for a 2017 vintage phone camera. However this is not a big deal for me... I always carry a Nikon or Sony point & shoot camera with me. I rarely use the phone camera except when I really can't wait to share a photo. Set up was easy on ATT. I did have to go into the store to get a nano sim card but it worked fine and everything connected to ATT network with no problems. I also expanded the 16gb internal memory with a 32gb microSD card.... use the procedure to format it as internal on MOTO web site. The wifi receiving range is better than my old S3 and the battery life is very good. Overall this is a good value  phone for you if you are new to smart phones or don't need a lot of power to run games. However if you want to take a lot of good quality photos to share, then bump up your budget and get something with a better camera like the G5 plus.","images":[],"asin":"B071YC3G5V","parent_asin":"B071YC3G5V","user_id":"AFTM7LRBJ6JXRS6SGJ45DWITCGSQ","timestamp":1507770399559,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":222,"phone_score":-0.5822583437,"battery_score":-0.5822583437,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":-0.5822583437,"price_score":-0.5822583437,"phones_score":-0.5822583437,"life_score":-0.5822583437,"quality_score":-0.5822583437,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.5822583437,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":-0.5822583437,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":-0.5822583437,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Armored Phone with Great Features","text":"I ordered this as a spare phone to take with me to places I do not want to take my S21. This phone is way better than I imagined, it could be my primary phone. First off the phone feels solid and fits well in my hand. Fit and finish are world class. The phone comes with a standard Android 11 with no bloateware and a few customizations. The screen is IPS but is very clear and readable in a variety of conditions. The processor is responsive and is good for some gaming, according to my 9 year old that \"borrowed\" it to test the gaming.<br \/>I bought the 64 GB version which has plenty of space for apps, the X9 also allows for a micro SD expansion. The X9 is dual Sim compatible if you need 2 numbers. The X9 offers a headphone jack (not common any more) which is nice for listening when you have only wired options. The only down side I found is the lack of USB C charging, the phone has standard micro USB charging. This is a plus for compatability, since even the most hard-core fruit based phone housholds have some of these cables around. I found that I did not notice the micro charger much since the battery capacity is massive, I have owned the phone 3 days and only plugged it in when I first set it up.<br \/>The X9 is the ultimate outdoor adventure phone, gets wet - no problem, drop it - no problem,  no power - no problem, too cold -no problem (for the phone) want to do underwater photography-no problem (there is even an app for that included). This is the main selling point of the X9 as I originally thought but I found myself grabbing this phone over my primary Galaxy devices because I liked the look and feel of the X9.<br \/>Quirks and features:<br \/>Dual SIM<br \/>Real headphone jack<br \/>Customizable function button<br \/>5Ghz \/2 Ghz wifi<br \/>Metal accent bars<br \/>Micro SD expansion<br \/>Dual SIM<br \/>IP68 \/IP69K Intrusion protection (I had to Google that spec, it can get pressure washed)<br \/>Included tempered glass screen protector<br \/>Internal steel frame<br \/>Plugged ports<br \/>Face recognition (fast and accurate)<br \/>Dual rear camera 13 Mp<br \/>Good speakers\/ speakerphone (not always common on a ruggedized phone)<br \/>Underwater and glove modes<br \/>Included charger and cable<br \/><br \/>Conclusion:<br \/>This is a really great armored \/ ruggedized phone that can be your primary phone. It fits nicely in your hand, your pocket, your swim trunks, or your life vest. This phone will survive almost anything and if it doesn't, it cost less than the tax on a new S or Fruit phone.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61vWVRfaR0L._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61vWVRfaR0L._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61vWVRfaR0L._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61xknqDCtOL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61xknqDCtOL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61xknqDCtOL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B09GBDQNTJ","parent_asin":"B09GBDQNTJ","user_id":"AELFFUS57GYHAKR7X3DNHY3URCLA","timestamp":1638031821527,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":446,"phone_score":0.9878260493,"battery_score":0.9878260493,"screen_score":0.9878260493,"camera_score":0.9878260493,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.9878260493,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.9878260493,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9878260493,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.9878260493,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9878260493,"wifi_score":0.9878260493,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Durable and not bulky smart phone","text":"I've dropped this phone from over 1 story at a work site and all that happened was the force of the impact made the battery come out and it left a little scuff mark on the edge of the phone. Aside from that, everything in it still works fine. Also it's a pretty slim phone that you can easily carry around in your pockets. The camera is nice, I've used it for a few shots in a short film I'm putting together. The only complaints I have are: the touch sensitivity can be kinda lacking, sometimes I have the touch screen doesn't register in certain spots, so I have to press a few times or harder. Also it would be nice if I could figure out how to turn off the tint on the screen, idk if it's a permanent blue light filter, but it throws me off sometimes. Lastly, I really hate how samsung tries to encourage you to use it's Bixby feature, which gets in the way of other task that are more important, like turning off the phone.. now you have to press and hold two buttons at the same time (power and down volume) to prompt the phone to turn off, restart, or go in airplane mode. However if you accidentally press and hold just the power button, it activates Bixby, pretty annoying and invasive, imo. I would still recommend, or if you have more money, maybe look into the Cat phones, I think they're american made too!","images":[],"asin":"B085WTR7BJ","parent_asin":"B085WTR7BJ","user_id":"AEQZH4PRIAWZNT5HG5OKIL6OHG7A","timestamp":1641333625346,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":252,"phone_score":0.5197375417,"battery_score":0.5197375417,"screen_score":0.5197375417,"camera_score":0.5197375417,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.5197375417,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.5197375417,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Fun, but less functional","text":"So, I thought this phone would be perfect for me. In a way it is, but it also isn't. As a background: I usually break phones, even despite my efforts to keep them intact. I landscape, go hiking, and am outdoors most of the time.  I was drawn to a smaller phone because I'm annoyed by how large they are. But this one, it is tiny. I am a slender woman and my fingers hit the wrong button 3\/10 times. This can get annoying, especially when I just want to check the weather or do something simple that I thought this phone would be perfect for. And if you have nails, forget it!<br \/><br \/>The photos are poor quality, and if you do post or send them to people, expect them to be blurry. When I receive a photo, I usually email it to my computer so I can actually see what I am looking at. I am not a person who likes to be on my phone, but the size has really made it difficult. Even texting is a huge challenge. Do I spend less time on the phone? Maybe? but really as everything, you get used to it and adapt. And I am left wanting something more streamlined that offers me the ability to send a picture of flowers, birds, insects and mountains.<br \/><br \/>The big issue is after only a few months the rubber started to detach from the body. Then, a few days later it dropped from my lap and the screen shattered (!) (Previously, I had been tossing my phone around and it would fall with no problem). I contacted unihertz and because I bought it through amazon, they were unwilling to offer a refund. So I am stuck with a broken super durable tiny phone that is now more difficult to use due to the cracked small screen.<br \/><br \/>I love the concept, and I do love how unique and fun it is. EVERYONE always asks, what is that, and is shocked when I reply, my phone. I enjoy how portable and durable it is (besides mine being defective). I loved it at the beginning, but after a few months of using it, I am now over it and wish there was a phone size between this and the now \"compact\" 4.7\" screens.","images":[],"asin":"B07KP8J8YN","parent_asin":"B07KP8J8YN","user_id":"AGPXQKEUHLO7X3VDN4UWSSC2KCNQ","timestamp":1591630614670,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":389,"phone_score":-0.6258640289,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.6258639693,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.6258640289,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.6258639693,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":-0.6258640289}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great deal. Good value for the money.","text":"They unit I bought was a reconditioned T-Mobile version. It has the T-Mobile boot screen and some T-Mobile voice mail apps but other than that it is remarkably devoid of carrier installed apps.<br \/><br \/>Migrating from my old phone, Samsung Galaxy S8, using the OnePlus migration app was only partially successful. I think OnePlus can make a lot of improvements there. There was a lot of manual cleanup and reconfiguration to be done by me.<br \/><br \/>The fingerprint reader is not as comfortable or conveniently located as my previous phone, which had it on the back rather than in the screen.<br \/><br \/>Initially, the Bluetooth system didn't work with my car and only played the audio but didn't communicate track information. Then, just a few weeks ago, on a phone reboot, the operating system updated (unannounced I have to say, what's up with that OnePlus?) and for a while (about 30 minutes and multiple reboots) the phone didn't even recognize the SIM card.<br \/><br \/>Luckily, after leaving the phone powered off for a while, the SIM was recognized and, to my pleasant surprise, the Bluetooth system works much better now, communicating track information to my car. It still doesn't show status information, like battery charge level, from my portable speaker like my previous phone did.<br \/><br \/>All in all, I like the phone. It has good solid 5G performance, has a nice large screen and good cameras. It's too bad it doesn't have an SD card reader.<br \/><br \/>One bit I'd like to pick is that the sensitivity of the Back, Home, and Open Apps buttons are very sensitive to the point that tapping the spacebar while typing a message hides the message app and shows the Home screen, for instance. Perhaps these three buttons should be hidden when the keyboard is up.<br \/><br \/>I think purchasing this reconditioned phone was a good deal and saved me a lot compared to buying a current flagship phone from OnePlus or any other manufacturer.","images":[],"asin":"B08GL5CWNS","parent_asin":"B08GL5CWNS","user_id":"AGNOHXRV2UDYVB2LF7DVZ2KGRC5Q","timestamp":1622301517605,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":332,"phone_score":-0.6665941477,"battery_score":-0.6665941477,"screen_score":-0.6665941477,"camera_score":-0.6665941477,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.6665941477,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":-0.6665941477,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.6665941477,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

It's so nice and crisp at the focal point, but no matter what settings I use the top half is always extra blurry. I'm forced to take pictures farther away and then crop them to avoid this.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Apple iPhone 4S, Does it Live up to the Hype?","text":"I entered the smartphone world back in 2008 staring with the Apple iPhone 3G.  Coming over from my old Sprint flip-phone, the iPhone 3G was a major upgrade and blew my mind with how much it could do.  It was amazing that cell phones had advanced into a sort of mini-PC.<br \/><br \/>Fast forward to the present-day and I have now used and experimented with various smartphones, different cellphone companies, and smartphones OS's (iOS, Android, Windows, etc).  I also run my own small cell phone shop and get to play with these devices on a daily basis.  Back in the iPhone 3G days, there were only a few smartphone options to choose from.  Today there are literally hundreds of devices across several carriers.  All with different functions and designs.  I'm going to cover how the iPhone 4S stacks up to the competition, what the competition is, what the 4S can do, and what improvements it makes over its predecessor, the iPhone 4.<br \/><br \/>HARDWARE<br \/>The iPhone 4S is almost identical in hardware design to the iPhone 4.  It features the same rectangular shape with the flat gorilla glass back and front screen.  The front and rear camera are in the same position.  The only visible difference on the outside of the phone is that the volume controls are slightly moved on the 4S.  The real difference in the hardware is on the inside.  The iPhone 4S uses a dual-core \"A5\" processor.  This makes it significantly faster than the iPhone 4.  The processor is the raw power that apps need in order to operate fast and fluidly without slowdown or hiccups.  With basic use, users probably won't notice much difference from the iPhone 4's speed.  The extra power boost mainly shows its worth when playing some of the more high-end iOS games and apps.<br \/><br \/>CAMERA<br \/>In addition to the new processor, the iPhone 4S has an improved 8 megapixel camera.  It also now has the ability to capture full 1080p HD Video.  Unless you're a professional photographer, you will be blown away with how great the 4S is at taking pictures.  It is on par with most of the dedicated point-and-shoot cameras that are currently on the market.  Images are clear, crisp, and very colorful.  I even sold my 10MP Canon point-and-shoot after using the 4S for a few weeks.  When comparing pictures taken with the iPhone 4 side by side to the 4S, the difference is like night and day.  As for the 1080P videos, they're also very beautiful.  Just like the photos, the videos rival dedicated point-and-shoot devices and look absolutely gorgeous on the iPhone's retina display screen.  The only drawback to these 1080p videos is that they can take up large amounts of memory.  So if you plan on shooting a large amount of video, you may need to consider getting the 32GB or 64GB iPhone 4S.<br \/><br \/>SIGNAL RECEPTION AND DATA SPEEDS<br \/>The iPhone 4S has been expanded to include a 3rd US carrier Sprint.  This brings your total choices to Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint.<br \/>Signal reception and data speeds will vary by carrier and location, so I'll give you some basic information about what to expect on average.  Signal reception is greatly improved compared to the iPhone 4.  The antenna problem from the iPhone 4 has been removed and the 4S uses separate antennas for incoming and outgoing calls in order to increase overall reception. AT&T is a GSM carrier while Sprint and Verizon are CDMA carriers.  Verizon has the overall largest and most expansive voice coverage of the three, closely followed by AT&T, with Sprint in third.  The 4S Data speeds will largely vary by carrier and location.  Being a GSM carrier, AT&T is the only iPhone carrier capable of using the 4S's improved HSPA+ data speeds.  AT&T users will notice their iPhones showing \"4G\" in the top left corner rather than 3G.  Though this is faster than standard 3G, do not confuse it with the much faster 4G LTE network.  The iPhone 4S is not yet capable of using that network.  Verizon is second in 3G data speeds, with Sprint bringing up the rear.  Again, these are average speeds from across the nation.  Individual results may vary depending on your location.  It is also important to note that Sprint is the only carrier that still offers unlimited data.  This may be an important factor in choosing a carrier for some.<br \/><br \/>BATTERY LIFE<br \/>iPhone owners have come to expect excellent battery life from their devices.  Previous iPhones have ranked among the most impressive in terms of battery life compared to rival Android devices.  In the past each new iteration of the iPhone had better battery life than the previous device.  With the 4S however, the overall battery life is about the same as the iPhone 4.  Apple claims this is mainly because of the dual-core processor used by the 4S as well as the more demanding iOS 5 software that is included with the iPhone 4S.  Due to this, there were some widespread complaints about the iPhone 4S battery life initially.  Apple has since addressed the issue with their iOS 5.1 update.  The iPhone 4S now ranks among the top smartphones in overall battery life.  I can easily get through a full day on one full charge of average use.<br \/><br \/>SOFTWARE<br \/>Usually when comparing the iPhone to other phones, it comes down to the software.  There is a big ongoing debate among techies between the iPhone's operating system \"iOS\" and Google's \"Android\" operating system.  It's comparable to the famous PC vs Mac debate.  Rather than type a whole page comparing the two, I'll just cover a few basics.  The main difference between the two is choice.  Customize or not customize.  iOS is more fluid and crisp out of the box.  All iPhones\/iPods\/iPads use this standard OS.  Less powerful iOS devices are often able to move as fast or faster than more powerful Android counterparts.  However, major modifications and customizations of Apple's iOS are not possible.  The standard 4x4 row of icons is what you will get.  Android offers tons of customization options.  This is great for advanced tech users, but can be overwhelming to novice smartphone users or those not really interested in editing and customizing a lot to get the device to do what they need it to do.  I usually recommend iOS to customers new to smartphones due to its more simple and easy to use interface.  If you like customizing and making your the software on your phone look different from everyone else, I recommend an Android device.<br \/>The other major software difference between iOS and Android is the Apps.  The Apple app store still has by far the most support and overall apps from developers.  Most developers create an app for the iPhone first and port it later on to Android, or sometimes not at all.  From personal experiences with both, I can say that many times the iPhone version of an app usually runs better or has more features.<br \/><br \/>SIRI Personal Assistant<br \/>Unless you've been under a rock for the past few months, you've heard of the iPhone 4S's SIRI personal assistant software.  Apple touts it as a feature that allows you to speak voice commands to your iPhone and SIRI will do whatever you ask it to do.  Well it can do some things, but not quite everything.  SIRI is great for finding places for you.  You can say simple things like \"I'm hungry\" and SIRI will open the Maps App and show you the location of all restaurants in the nearby area.  You can also do things like tell it to play a certain song or artist from the music stored on your iPhone or ask it the Weather forecast for any given day.  SIRI can also be pretty entertaining when asked random conversational questions.  Questions such as \"How old are you?\" will cause SIRI to respond \"Does this concern you?\", \"I didn't think so\".  Or saying silly things such as \"SIRI I love you\" will cause it to say \"I'll bet you say that to all your Apple products\".  Overall it's a pretty nice added feature, but not a major selling point at this time.  It's limitation is that it currently is only integrated with the standard apps that Apple provides on the iPhone.  Once it is integrated with more of the third-part apps, I can see it becoming a seriously useful feature.<br \/><br \/>Overall I would definitely recommend the iPhone 4S.  From the sleek hardware design, the beautiful camera, and the very large Apple App store, it's my top phone at the moment.  The iPhone 4S has the battery life to last most people a full day and in terms of overall speed and ease of use, it is currently among the best available.  The only people who I would not recommend the 4S to are current iPhone 4 owners.  With all of the iPhone 4S's improvements, I don't feel like they're significant enough to spend more money to upgrade from your iPhone 4.  You will be better off waiting for whatever iPhone Apple releases later this year.  However if you're looking to purchase your first smartphone, tired of your old Blackberry or Android device, or just have an older iPhone 3GS or 3G, I would strongly recommend getting the iPhone 4S if possible.  Using a smartphone has never been easier.","images":[],"asin":"B005SSB0YO","parent_asin":"B005SSB0YO","user_id":"AFWW77H52G6KHXA2OYDY7ULVLUBQ","timestamp":1332527890000,"helpful_vote":264,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":1569,"phone_score":0.9246174097,"battery_score":0.9246174097,"screen_score":0.9246174097,"camera_score":0.9246174097,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.9246174097,"life_score":0.9246174097,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.9246174097,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.9246174097,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9246174097,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.9246174097,"memory_score":0.9246174097,"app_score":0.9246174097,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.9246175289,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"A little laggy but there are a few tips to make it faster.  :)","text":"So I've been looking at YouTube reviews of this phone and the lag aspect made me nervous.  It does have a bit of a lag to it on stock, but if you install Nova launcher and set the settings to performance vs animations,  then go into system settings&#62;developers mode and turn off all animations as well as only allow 2-3 background processes at a time,  the phone gets pretty snappy. Then go ahead and install SwiftKey keyboard which makes things run even smoother and turn off vibration for key strokes.<br \/><br \/>Lastly,  buying a big SD card and installing as many apps as you can on it will help with the small storage space this phone has.<br \/><br \/>I was thinking of sending it back until I did all these things,  now I love it and am happy with it as a budget phone.<br \/><br \/>Update: charged the phone all night last night, and used it all day today, sometimes pretty heavily. I just had to put it on the charger at 16% battery, at 10:30 pm. I can see it lasting for days if only used to make calls and send texts, but not as a heavy user. But heck, even getting a full day's worth out of a phone without having to charge it is great in my book. Battery life may even improve once I'm not in the &#34;setting my phone up&#34; phase.<br \/><br \/>I've also included a photo I took with the camera on this. It's not as good a camera as my old iPhone 4S But it's not terrible either. The pink around the edges is a little frame thing you can select.<br \/><br \/>Update #2:<br \/><br \/>So far it's still pretty good but I am missing the camera on my iPhone 4S. I mainly take pictures of my kids and none of them come out as clear as they did even using an older iPhone camera. It's a bit frustrating.<br \/><br \/>Update #3:<br \/><br \/>I returned this phone. Lollipop update was nowhere in sight, attempting to contact BLU to ask about it got generic replies saying G there is no update for this phone at the time. Who knows if it'll ever get lollipop, as far as I know,  it hasn't (as of 8\/11\/15) and it was supposed to get it back in June.<br \/><br \/>Also the camera on this phone is horrible. I'm a mom who likes to take pictures of my kids and the camera on this was just NOT good. Any movement resulted in tons of blur.<br \/><br \/>Lastly, the battery... Yes I do miss not having to plug my phone in all day but the battery made the phone so heavy that I literally got cramps in my fingers from holding it. Adding any kind of case other than a thin rubber one just made it much heavier. I ended up buying a 'love handle' (Google it lol) and attaching it to the back of a hybrid case I had bought for it,  but it was still heavy and cumbersome. I kept it in a pocket of my scrubs at work and it would drag my pants down slowly as I walked so I always had to hike my pants up.<br \/><br \/>I switched to a Moto G (2nd generation) and I am much happier with it (hello lollipop update!).

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good value WP7 smartphone","text":"I have lived with the DVP 16gb for about 6 months now, shortly after I first purchased it I received the Nodo update and then Mango. I have heard difficult experiences with the DVP before the Nodo\/Mango combo, I have not experienced any major problems with the exception of the following:<br \/><br \/> - With Mango, the compass on the DVP does not work. This is well documented and you can Google it too. You may or may not care about this. There are some examples where this might matter. For example, when using gps and moving slowly in one direction, the gps can get confused and u-turn the direction it thinks you're going, and u-turn again, in a sense, spinning, until you pick up speed and the direction is obvious.<br \/><br \/> - The camera is abysmal. It is almost impossible to get a non-blurred shot indoors even if you think there is adequate light.<br \/><br \/>As a point of reference to what I'm comparing the above problems to, my last phone was the ancient Nokia 5800 and a Sony Arc S (aka LT18i). Curiously, the video recording is surprisingly sharp, especially compared to its picture taking. I still give the phone 4 stars based on the following positive points:<br \/><br \/> - outstanding no-data-plan gps lock performance: combined with the Navigon gps app, I was pleasantly surprised that without a data plan, gps lock consistently took only a few seconds. This has turned my DVP into a reliable gps unit with offline maps and addresses.<br \/> - stability: I've had only 2 crashes in 6 months, and about 10 freezes which required a restart, but that could be due to the apps I was downloading and playing with. Overall, I have the impression its reliable and stable.<br \/> - decent build quality: the slider mechanism is the point of focus in long-term wear and tear, and it seems to be holding up well. It has developed a slightly looser play, or jiggle, if you apply horizontal pressure, but nothing serious. The screen is still responsive and no dead pixels yet. The phone is encased with Otterbox and I have dropped it a few times on hard surfaces with no problems.<br \/> - value: I had pretty low expectations for how much I purchased it for. A 4.1 inch screen with a hardware keyboard, no major problems, and a reliable gps unit, so far it has been a great value.<br \/><br \/>Now for the cons (considering it is lower-end phone with a price to match):<br \/><br \/> - abysmal camera. Really. 5MP might as well be 0.5MP with all the blur. The quality is so low that I can't even use it for contact pictures because it's that blurry.<br \/> - big size and weight. The Sony Arc S feels like half its size and weight, and it's uncomfortable when I put this in my inside jacket pocket. Battery performance feels like average (so it's not a heavy-duty battery weighing the DVP down, it's probably the slider mechanism). The Otterbox case doesn't help either, but its construction is top-notch and fits the DVP tightly.<br \/> - below-average mono-speaker performance (although it looks like 2 speakers on the bottom of the phone, only one is used as the speaker). You may not care about this if you primarily use earphones or don't use speakerphone often.<br \/> - too-sensitive search button (bottom right touch button)<br \/><br \/>In regards to Mango, coming from Symbian (S60 5th) and Android (Gingerbread), I'm losing flexibility, both in file access capabilities and app choices. Mango + DVP has proven to be more stable though than Gingerbread + Sony Arc S, as the latter has already had a few random restarts. And it is worlds more stable than Symbian + Nokia 5800. Overally, I'm very happy with its value and that I can use it as a reliable gps unit.","images":[],"asin":"B004LRVNG8","parent_asin":"B004LRVNG8","user_id":"AHNKMGPVNBTFJYSOLFWNJ4C2B5XQ","timestamp":1333326487000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":653,"phone_score":0.5389507413,"battery_score":0.5389507413,"screen_score":0.5389507413,"camera_score":0.5389507413,"price_score":0.5389507413,"phones_score":0.5389507413,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.5389507413,"apps_score":0.5389507413,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.5389507413,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.5389507413,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.5389507413}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Good phone with WiFi issues and Lag","text":"I have been using this phone for over a month now. Initially, I was very pleased with the specs especially for that price point. However, after a few months of using it, I have come to find some issues with it. First, I experience lags while using it. I often have to wait for a few moments after opening an app before it comes up or for the next screen to display. Secondly, the Wifi reception is very weak. It seems I have to be VERY close to the router or source of the Wifi to get a signal. Very often, it doesn't even connect at all when I am not far from the router. For example, my bedroom is 2 floors away from the router but I usually do not get a signal in my room and whenever I do, it is very weak. All my other devices(laptop and even a low-end tablet) get a strong signal.  This is really a letdown for me because it is difficult to connect to WiFi at home and on campus where I usually am. If WiFi connectivity is very important to you and you won't always be very close to a router, I won't recommend this device for you.<br \/><br \/>That being said, the display is good (large screen and high resolution), the camera rating is high and it has a lot of storage space.<br \/><br \/>I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't lag and have the WiFi problem.","images":[],"asin":"B00H87XB2W","parent_asin":"B00H87XB2W","user_id":"AECMTA5QNQGFAED3PSE4FSM34GTQ","timestamp":1408478003000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":250,"phone_score":-0.9019918442,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.9019918442,"camera_score":-0.9019918442,"price_score":-0.9019918442,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.9019918442,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9019918442,"wifi_score":-0.9019918442,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I saved at least $60 total because the phone was less expensive than buying it from Tracfone too. Edit... I have been using it now for a while and can say this is a very good phone for a very good price.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Cellphone without phone functionality","text":"My phone needs are very simple: make calls. That's it! That's all I want from a cellphone. And yet somehow, Motorola\/Lenovo failed on this very basic function. I've had this for 3 months and during that time, on two occasions now, the phone has mysteriously decided to stop connecting to the cellular (or wifi) network. No rhyme or reason to it. I've gone through online posts, help desks, phone resets, had AT&T replace the SIM, but not no avail. The first time this happened was in August, after roughly one month of ownership. Randomly stopped connecting, and two days later randomly worked again. I'm on day two of this latest stint but I suspect I'm going to have to write this off as a &#34;buyer beware&#34; and spring for a new phone from a different company.<br \/>The foundation of a cellphone is the ability to make calls. Not the apps, not the GPS, not the texting; just make phone calls. If a product is unable to do that, what good is all of the other bells and whistles? The processor was fast enough, the RAM was enough, the hd capacity was enough. It's a baseline phone but it did all that superfluous stuff that people seem to need these days well-enough for its price. What it completely fails to do, however, is reliably stay connected to the cellular network and without that, it's little more than a $100 brick of plastic. Look elsewhere for your basic phone needs because Motorola\/Lenovo can't deliver.","images":[],"asin":"B071YC3G5V","parent_asin":"B071YC3G5V","user_id":"AEQDNX6RM4PUIIKTC7FL7M3ZJGAQ","timestamp":1507480174263,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":252,"phone_score":-0.6767163277,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":-0.6767163277,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.6767163277,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.6767163277,"wifi_score":-0.6767163277,"cell_score":-0.6767163277,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Outstanding phone for the price. Works on Cricket.","text":"I'm coming from an LG Stylo 4 which was a good budget phone. But this G8 Plus is a huge improvement. I purchased it at $200, but would satisfied even if it was $300.<br \/>Battery: Possibly one of the best features of this phone. My Stylo 4 battery life was very good. With the G8 plus,  light use I can get through the day and maybe drop to 75%. Honestly, I don't think I've gone below 50% with moderate use during a day. It does have quick charge, but I don't think it has wireless charging.<br \/>Speaker: Big improvement. Comparable to some cheaper blue tooth speakers. Great for a phone.<br \/>Speed: very good most of the time (again, huge improvement over my Stylo 4). Probably not as good as your higher end iphones\/androids but most will be satisfied.<br \/>Cell reception: No issues. At least as good as my previous phone on Cricket (uses AT&T towers).<br \/>WiFi\/bluetooth: No connection problems with me.<br \/>Fingerprint scanner: Gets it right probably 90% of the time. As good or better than other fingerprint phones. I haven't tried the facial recognition method and I'm not really interested it it.<br \/>Cameras: Lots of features and quality with main camera. Front camera is also decent. This camera was another huge improvement over my Stylo 4. It's probably not as good as some high end phones, but it's not far behind either.<br \/>Storage: Decent amount of on board storage and can add micro SD card which I did. I've had no issues with my SD card.<br \/>Screen: Good image quality. The max brightness is a weak point. In very bright locations I can see the screen, but I wish it was brighter. This is a small step down from my Stylo 4.<br \/>Screen sensitivity: Generally good, but I have a screen protector on it. Sometimes I have to retap but the protector may be a factor. If there is any sensitivity reduction it's small.<br \/>OS: Currently at Android 9 (as of 2\/20\/20) even though 10 has been out for several months. Not a big deal for me, but if you have to have the latest OS then stick with Google phones.<br \/><br \/>Overall this is an outstanding phone for the price. I thought it wasn't available in the US. Apparently it is, but not officially so you might not have a warranty. Buying through Amazon effectively gives you a short term warranty via the return window. This phone competes with some $500+ phones. It was a quick transition from my old phone (had function to easily directly transfer data). The phone has other neat quick gesture features to access the flash light and camera in addition to other things.","images":[],"asin":"B082WNRSPY","parent_asin":"B082WNRSPY","user_id":"AE5CYPKVAZBB23K5NKVHTQWRBKAA","timestamp":1582218674438,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":450,"phone_score":0.9350699782,"battery_score":0.9350699782,"screen_score":0.9350699782,"camera_score":0.9350699782,"price_score":0.9350699782,"phones_score":0.9350699782,"life_score":0.9350699782,"quality_score":0.9350699782,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.9350699782,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9350699782,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9350699782,"wifi_score":0.9350699782,"cell_score":0.9350699782,"size_score":0.0}

All was well then one day I noticed while the phone was offf and charging the green light was on. I pushed power and the battery icon showed 74%. ??? !!! Not 100% So what does that mean? So I turn it back on and it says 74% and charging. The next day I charged to 85% while on. Then turned it off and left it charging and it said it was at 74%, not 85%. So today, the battery life estimate on battery only says 85% with approximately 2 hours left. ***This was not the case when I got it. SO I reset FOUR (4) x's.

First, the first one i got for christmas started freezing up and anyone who called me will hear me but i couldn't hear them at all. The phone will work in different places and in some places, nothing! I complained to T-mobile  and they went through the master resetting with me but to no avail. Finally, i returned it and they mailed me a new one. The new on was a piece of CRAP! This made me lose a few of my friends because they said i wasn't picking up my phone. The phone stopped ringing and it will only blink. you can change the ringtone but the new one will get corrupted in a few hours.Then a month later, the phone stopped working completely. Nothing will make it work so i sent it back to tmobile. Now the next replacement. This new one only lasted two days. Yes! Please, if you rely so much on your cell phone then, for your own sake don't get tmobile shadow because it will live up to its name \"It will only be a shadow of a phone\"! It needs MAJOR improvements.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good Phone W\/Weak Battery","text":"This is my second 8100 (1st one died as I left it in the washer) but to this date, this is the best Sprint PCS phone that I have used.  This was recommended to me by the salesman at the Sprint store over a year ago.  Here is the quick list:<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>1)  Signal:  Rarely do I ever experience any drop calls with this phone compared to my last 2 Samsungs.<br \/><br \/>2)  Display:  Very clear and vibrant.<br \/><br \/>3)  Quality:  As soon as you pick up the phone you feel the quality that it is made.  It does not have the Cheap feel on some of the Nokia and Samsung phones.  My first one was made in Japan and this one is from Malaysia.  Sanyo just makes quality phones.<br \/><br \/>Dislikes<br \/><br \/>1)  Battery Life:  The standard battery is weak.  It rarely lasted more than 2 days when it was brand new and now its about 1 day for me.  And I have 2 batteries.  I purchased an extended battery on Ebay for about $10 and it works great.<br \/><br \/>2) Poor camera under low light:  But what do you expect with a cell phone right?<br \/><br \/>Overall, its a nice phone I only wish Sprint would carry more Sanyos and Motorolas and stop carrying the terrible Nokias and Samsungs.","images":[],"asin":"B0000AYKXG","parent_asin":"B0000AYKXG","user_id":"AHWRV5OTXDW6OH4AJXTUZ57I3PQQ","timestamp":1117060750000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":223,"phone_score":0.9386873841,"battery_score":0.9386873841,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.9386873841,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.9386873841,"life_score":0.9386873841,"quality_score":0.9386873841,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.9386873841,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.9386873841,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Currently best in its price range","text":"I purchased this phone for my mom. She's not a big techie and just wanted the best she could get in the sub $300 range. Further, it had to be compatible with Verizon which limits a lot of the import phones out there. I feel like the Moto G5 Plus fit the bill perfectly.<br \/>First, we selected the 64gb version mainly because it comes with 4gb of ram as opposed to the 32gb version that only comes with 2gb. I felt like the extended ram would make the phones useful life as well as limit multitasking lag.<br \/><br \/>First impression: I was worried the bezel would look big and imposing by today's standards but in person it isn't bad looking at all. Its no Galaxy S8 but coming in at almost $550 cheaper I cant complain. The default launcher is a bit clunky and the icon and background choice make the screen look washed out and boring. They say first impressions are everything and if Motorola wants to win an easy point here the initial power on should greet you with something that showcases their product. This is easily remedied however with a quick visit to the google play store. My personal choice is the paid version of Nova launcher but I've also found the free Evie launcher to be a great modern looking alternative. Just a personal preference but I'd also switch out the icon theme to a modern look with either Pixel Icon Pack or Rondo. Both are circular themes that fit in well with current modern design trends.<br \/><br \/>Once the phone was setup I found everything to be fast and responsive. This is one of the only &#34;bargain phones&#34; I came across to include the latest Android 7.1 N. Overall, its a great user experience.<br \/><br \/>Other points of interest:<br \/>Camera: I've read it uses the same sony image sensor as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and so far it seems to be one of the strongest selling points. I haven't run it through its paces but the initial results are amazing especially for the price point.<br \/><br \/>Finger print sensor: Quick as any I've ever used. Any delay defeats the purpose in my book and this sensor does the job well. An interesting feature that can be enabled is the ability to use the fingerprint sensor to navigate with swipes. While this might not sound useful I was amazed at how intuitive and easy it was to use. Its a feature I now wish other manufactures would implement.<br \/><br \/>Lastly AD's: I hate ads. I'm the type who will pay the premium on apps I use to remove ads as I prefer a clean uncluttered work-space. The Amazon ad discount was probably the single biggest pause I had on this purchase. After using the phone I feel those fears have been eased. The ads only appear on the lock screen and I really feel like they were so unobtrusive that I couldn't justify paying more to just remove them. When I use my phone I may use my lock screen to check the time but otherwise I'm in so quickly the ads are effectively gone.<br \/><br \/>While the phone wasn't a personal purchase I couldn't help but feel like I would be happy using this as my daily driver. You get a lot of bang for the buck especially with the Amazon Prime discount.<br \/>I'd say if you want:<br \/>1) an unlocked phone that works on all US carriers<br \/>2) has the latest operating system<br \/>3) a fast processor<br \/>4) great camera<br \/>5) plenty of memory (64gb plus SD card expandable)<br \/>6) plenty of ram<br \/>7) and finally a great price<br \/>then this would be the one to choose.","images":[],"asin":"B01N6NTIRH","parent_asin":"B01N6NTIRH","user_id":"AEPF67GS5GJXRDXHJGTJIZTDTVFA","timestamp":1492726940000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":623,"phone_score":0.9320226908,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.9320226908,"camera_score":0.9320226908,"price_score":0.9320226908,"phones_score":0.9320226908,"life_score":0.9320226908,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.9320226908,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.9320226908,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.9320226908,"app_score":0.9320226908,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"I like it with few reservations, so far...","text":"I have had my MDA for only about one week. So far no complaints. Becoming use to its way of doing things does require a bit of patience. It's not as easy to use as a PC, but the Windows Mobile V5.0 OS does in many ways make the MDA seem very familiar. After several hours of use it is becoming second nature and intuitive.<br \/><br \/>I had no problem installing the Opera browser to replace\/augment Internet Explorer. I have had absolutely no problems syncing to my Toshiba laptop via USB. It worked the first try right out of the box. Gmail also works perfectly.<br \/><br \/>The MDA offers a \"Connections\" screen that provides central access to all available means of connection. This menu is instantly accessible by pushing a button on the exterior-top-left-side of the MDA. Branching from the connections screen is another screen that effortlessly scans for all available WiFi networks. From my location it found six or eight available non-T-Mobile WiFi networks.<br \/><br \/>I have not yet experienced any power problems. The exterior buttons are designed to prevent inadvertent button mistakes. The menus offer several options to turn off any features that may not presently be in use such as WiFi, and Bluetooth.  There are also options to blank the screen and further throttle-back the device for periods of inactivity. Amateur Radio operators (Hams) always carry a spare battery. It's a good idea for any portable device that absolutely must function. Batteries do fail. The MDA battery is roughly the size of a pat of butter.<br \/><br \/>The camera produces a worthy snapshot. Better than nothing if I should happen to spot some creatures from outer-space.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Not worth even trying.","text":"I have had two Blu phones before this one and have loved them so much that I hate getting rid of them. Eventually they get so old they slow down to the point they cant be used any more. As far as this goes, this phone is not worth even trying. I bought it even though the reviews said it warms up very quickly. Well it does. It gets so hot I thought it was going to catch fire. You can feel it on your ear while making a phone call. When just using it you can feel it though the case. Also the camera is JUNK! It will only focus when the subject is not moving and with children this does not happen. My last Blu phone took great pictures, I am not sure what happened to this phone. It has a awful delay when trying to take a picture. It makes you wait a while before it allows you to take another picture. I tried adjusting the setting for the camera and nothing helped. Its JUNK! Overall VERY disappointed with this phone. I loved BLU products before this phone. I sure hope they fix this issue for future phones!","images":[],"asin":"B078X5MGL7","parent_asin":"B078X5MGL7","user_id":"AHSIX35C5TVS3B2CT5QJSGN4GGKA","timestamp":1548039108901,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":201,"phone_score":-0.932919085,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":-0.932919085,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.932919085,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.932919085,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.932919085,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Works great so far!","text":"I've had the phone about a month now and I love it.  I sent a Samsung S20 back because it absolutely would not allow me to do updates on my unlimited data plan which is a problem because I'm often in areas with no wifi or the wifi is also LTE based with data limits.<br \/><br \/>An associate pointed me to this brand and I was thrilled with the dual sim idea!  No more dragging 2 phones around. (one work, one personal)  It will ring to whatever number calls in and I can easily tell it what number to use when texting or calling out.  Slick!<br \/><br \/>Text to speech seems to work better on this one, too, although I still can't use it anymore when I'm on a call.  (my old LG would do that lol) So it's a chore to answer a text message if I'm on a call.<br \/><br \/>I read online the fingerprint reader is inconvenient, but I love it where it is... you're going to push that button anyway so the reader there unlocks the phone instantly.  And it takes multiple fingerprints, so even easier to unlock one handed.<br \/><br \/>I don't game on my phone, so I have no idea of how it runs games, but so far, for half the money of the samsung, I have a phone that I truly enjoy. =-)","images":[],"asin":"B08C5HL4TG","parent_asin":"B08C5HL4TG","user_id":"AHT3K4TTDRC4GHG6PFR4HBMKXCWQ","timestamp":1641568868319,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":230,"phone_score":0.8615114689,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.8615114689,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.8615114689,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

Look I don't need everything on the Galaxy note not do i need 1,000 apps that come with it. So, I can save some money and still get android jelly bean and get that hot spot that I want. I just ordered this phone for my friend on my account he is anxious to get his and I'm anxious to see it as well. So, soon as I sell my note on amazon I will be getting this blu phone right here. I had a unlocked galaxy note and connected it with Solavie\/T-mobile phone service it was no contract sim card company. Me and my friend will be using it with this blu as well. The service is great and customer service, it's $49 Unlimited Talk Text Data 4g Nationwide no contract and if you share with others you can earn $ just by sharring so that was a huge perk for me.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Will work on Verizon","text":"I've had this phone for a few months using it with straight talk and so far I like it just as well as the note 9 that it replaced after an accident. Also yes this phone will work on Verizon. I don't know why it's not common knowledge at this point but Verizon made a press release last year stating that back in January they started phasing out their cdma network. All new Verizon phones are gsm now and cdma will not work at all after dec 31 2020. Just letting people know, you can look it up if you don't believe me but i assure you its true. Now to the review.<br \/><br \/>Screen is great, camera is decent. The battery life isn't too bad and gets me through a whole day of streaming music at work, watching YouTube and browsing the internet and leaves me around 20-30 percent at the end of a typical day. Fast charging is good and can charge the phone from dead to 100 in about an hour and a half. The international model here that I ordered does infact come with 8gbs ram and 128gbs storage and is plenty fast for my needs. In the box was the fast charger, usb c cable, wired ear buds, extra tips for the s pen with the removal tool, sim tool and a clear gel case. The only real issue I've had with the phone is the fingerprint sensor not being reliable but the work around I found that works is to add the finger I use the most for unlocking my phone twice when setting it up and haven't had an issue since. I've not used the facial recognition so can't give any feedback there. Overall I'm pleased and have reordered this phone for gifts this xmas.","images":[],"asin":"B084MD6Y5H","parent_asin":"B084MD6Y5H","user_id":"AF7KAP7HG6DWHXUDCSGJKNAR3IWQ","timestamp":1607097772588,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":302,"phone_score":0.8868368864,"battery_score":0.8868368864,"screen_score":0.8868368864,"camera_score":0.8868368864,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.8868368864,"life_score":0.8868368864,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.8868368864,"case_score":0.8868368864,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I did this for over 5 months before I gave up with my Nexus 6P last year.<br \/><br \/>3.

Unihertz has little-to-no legitimate or unique IMEIs for the Titan which are recognized by AT&T (because Unihertz never obtained hem properly in the first place).

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Really????","text":"Tried to up grade from S4. After several phone calls to boost mobile, found out by them it's not on the same signal ( so I was told) by tech department. Ok, then I went to a sprint store to get another sim to try and setup the phone on their network. Both people could not get the motog5 p[lus to work on their service but, I was told by a sprint rep that all I had to do was go down a pick up a sim they would be able to connect my new phone. That did not work either. giving me some excuse that they can only hook up their phones and not an unlocked phone. So I still purchased a sim for virgin boost and sprint and on the package it says &#34;Bring your own device&#34; WTH... So I get home and proceeded to deal with a virgin mobile. after 2 hours and porting my # over from Boost, he finally says the phone is not receiving any of the networks programs. Even after a hard restart we tried once more. Nothing. Now I am without a phone and the only way to get  any service is to port back over with boost. That means starting all over again and paying more money after several years of being a customer. So now I have to return a brand new phone and go back to what I had before and I paid for it dearly. so I had issues with 3 phone carriers. to top it all off I purchased phone case's, glass screen protectors and 2 nano sims. All which are useless...I read a lot of reviews and read the main issues is with Verizon. NOt true!!!! I will not be getting a new phone after this experience. It is going back to amazon.  Update 6\/18\/17 gave it one last try took phone to T-Mobile, fingers crossed... in less than 20 minutes new sim and motog5 plus was working with no problems. So for me problem solved.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"NOPE: 20-month UPDATE","text":"I no longer wanted to upgrade\/renew carrier contracts with payments for flagship phones. As nice as Samsung S phones are I just don't need a $100+\/mo bill. So when it was time to finally replace my S6 I looked into the latest unlocked options and found this Moto G7 Play to fit the bill for features, function, and price. I am super happy to have a paid-for phone with a $35\/mo prepaid account! The star off the overall rating is for the camera - it's crap, at least compared to the S6. I thought the 13MP camera of the G7 would vastly outperform the 8MP of the S6 - nope, so lesson learned about phone cameras. I'm glad I kept the Samsung to pull out for times that I want good photos! Otherwise I am quite happy with this phone. Storage capacity is expandable to 512 GB with a micro SD card, and hopefully the 128 GB I put in mine will outlast the phone. Screen is slightly larger than the S6 which is just right - I didn't get the straight G7 as it's like an inch longer and would feel weird. Battery life is awesome, but of course the real test will be how it holds up over time. The USB 3.0 connection is nice and the quick charge is legit - usually takes no more than an hour to go from my typical low of 10-15% to full.<br \/>UPDATE 9-2020: Taking a star off at this point and stating that I doubt I will buy this level Moto phone again. After 16 months it is becoming obvious that you get what you pay for and that is not going to be a 3-year phone here. Battery is still \"OK\" but has noticeably diminished, and in the frustratingly diminished department there is processing speed. Admittedly I get lazy about killing my background apps but even so this phone has become S-L-O-W, especially camera processing which is making one of the worst aspects this phone had when it was new often intolerable. No worries about outliving the 128g storage, anyway - I doubt I'll have this phone after Christmas.<br \/>UPDATE 11-2020: Sooo slow and HATE new update - horizontal \"page back\" swipe totally interferes with horiz. scrolling on most apps. The upward \"home\" swipe scrolls my text convo list about 2 pages down if you are not careful and don't do it s-l-o-w-l-y (guess it's a theme with this phone).

I switched my Verizon sim to the new phone and have never had an issue.  The phone is fast and reliable.  I mostly use it for talk, text, Quickbooks app, Calendar and Maps.  The battery is a true 2 day battery under most circumstance.  I do not game much on it, but gaming does use more battery power. The size is comfortable and seems light weight.  Screen resolution is fine and the fingerprint unlock feature actually works! It works really well. Never got the S10 fingerprint to work at all.

If you hold it at the right angle you can usually maneuver that, but it's still worth noting.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71+-K+DTnLL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71+-K+DTnLL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71+-K+DTnLL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B01MR2ZFBI","parent_asin":"B01MR2ZFBI","user_id":"AETEWC7F7IYHPC346DDFZ3MKDOVA","timestamp":1495118256000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":78,"phone_score":0.9947546721,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.991989553,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.989770174,"size_score":0.0}

Basic calling was all I needed while traveling. I didn't need all the fancy stuff that come with smart phones. So, I decided to purchase 3 more for family. Well, the 3 that I purchased are not excately the &#34;Motorola EX226&#34;. I was sent the &#34;Motorola Motokey Social&#34;. They look similar, but the difference is the &#34;Motorola Motokey Social&#34; has Facebook as the home key. So, the advertising is a bit missleading. I called the seller and they claimed that this was in fact the EX226 and they all have FB as the home key. I laughed and just sold the phone to someone that could use it with FB.  I give it a 2-star because I was able to sell at least 1 of the 3. I have two more, if someone wants it.","images":[],"asin":"B007Z4ZT46","parent_asin":"B007Z4ZT46","user_id":"AGQIBROQXDXBAQFFH4LTE4DS5JDA","timestamp":1396689365000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":154,"phone_score":0.0,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

It said &#34;No SIM card.&#34;  I reinstalled the SIM in my old phone, and it works fine.  I contacted Motorola Support and she walked me through several steps including a Factory Reboot of the phone.  It still wouldn't recognize the SIM. The Tech Support person told me I should return the phone to the place where I bought it. So today is Monday and I'm returning the phone to Amazon after only 3 days.  I've checked some online Android forums and it appears that there are many other people who had the exact same problem with their Moto G5 Plus not detecting or recognizing the SIM card.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"All Talk - No Action","text":"Having used this phone for the last 3 months, I think I have it figured out. It Sucks !!!<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>1. Has Bluetooth - Basic, but at least it has it<br \/><br \/>2. Brilliant color screen - pretty good screen<br \/><br \/>3. Adequate memory - stores tons of contacts & can add additional trans-flash memory<br \/><br \/>4. reception: better than other Motorola phones<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/><br \/>1. Bluetooth - Basic Bluetooth... all you can do is connect to a hands-free device. You sync your contacts, emails, calendar etc to your PC but you need to buy the PhoneTools software from Motorola. You cannot use it as a modem to connect to the internet for your laptop using Bluetooth - you have to buy a data cable for that.<br \/><br \/>2. Camera - Supposedly a 1.2 Mega pixel camera... it takes pics worse than my 2 year old Samsung camera. Very bad picture quality.<br \/><br \/>3. Antenna - you would expect for the price of the phone you get a good antenna, but the extendable antenna pops out very easily and I have already bent it in my pocket several times. Extendable antennae are past, all the new phones have fixed antennae.<br \/><br \/>4. Battery - My battery discharges in 3 hours now, even if I don't use it. Mine could be a defective battery.<br \/><br \/>5.  Build quality - right from day one I have noticed when I open the clamshell it makes scratches on the case... now remember, the case it black & it gets very visible.... This is really unacceptable.<br \/><br \/>I expected more from Motorola, but I am really disappointed. Bought it when it was first released since it was the latest & greatest... ouch.... what a mistake, I should have believed the other reviews. I guess Motorola knows about these flaws that why it came up with a newer model - V810\/E815 pretty much immediately.  Not sure how good the newer models are, but make sure you read the reviews before you buy them.","images":[],"asin":"B0002W2H2K","parent_asin":"B0002W2H2K","user_id":"AHGMR72GY2Y3VJTVCOTYH5J5RLHA","timestamp":1130863154000,"helpful_vote":6,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":340,"phone_score":-0.6325443387,"battery_score":-0.6325443387,"screen_score":-0.6325443387,"camera_score":-0.6325443387,"price_score":-0.6325443387,"phones_score":-0.6325443387,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.6325443387,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.6325443387,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.6325443387,"memory_score":-0.6325443387,"app_score":-0.6325443387,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Buyer beware:  No security patches or updates of any kind.","text":"I purchased this phone some 6 months ago.  3 months after purchasing came the &#34;stagefright&#34; vulnerability.  I checked my phone for updates, found none available... gave it a couple weeks, and then contacted Posh.  They informed me that they were looking into it.  Two months later, and no updates.  I contacted them, again.  Their reply was that they were in the pre-development stage with Lollipop.  Note:  this is no longer the most recent version of Android.  So, basically, what you can learn from this is that if your smartphone needs updates, you won't be getting them from Posh.  Expect zero security patches from this company.  For that reason, alone, I do not recommend this phone to anyone.  If it wasn't for that, I'd give it 5-stars.  As it is, I feel 3-stars for zero security patches on a smartphone is more than generous.","images":[],"asin":"B00NIB78XK","parent_asin":"B00NIB78XK","user_id":"AHM4AG6YDNKFIJQ4NKDCMFH4TVVQ","timestamp":1445623377000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":143,"phone_score":-0.7461537123,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Bulky Mid-Priced Phone","text":"I have had this phone for a very short time, so updates to this review will be in order. Firstly, this is a USB C device, so do yourself a favor and buy some USB to USB C adaptors when you purchase this if you don't already own any USB C wires.  None of the cords I have placed around my home for convenient charging work with this phone because they are all micro USB.  And before I forget, also buy at least a cheap soft case for this phone at the same time you buy this phone.  It is SLIPPERY and will slide off of any surface you place it on no matter which side you lay it on.  Be aware that this phone is almost a full inch longer than a LGMoto 5G Plus and a lot heavier (read the specs in the listings carefully.)  With small hands like mine, it's impossible to use this phone one-handed.  I tried in vain to find a smaller phone that had the features I wanted.  Why are they all so big now?  If I wanted to carry around my tablet, I would!  Having said all that, this is like a poor man's Samsung.  It offers a lot of features for a mid priced phone with less wow-factor.  It also comes with too much bloatware which you can't really uninstall. The camera is laden with features and customizations and is a bit daunting to use once you turn off auto.  However, I took some excellent video of an urban hawk having breakfast in my yard this morning, and with minimal fuss or tweaking on my part. The fingerprint sensor is fussy and it takes two or three tries before it works for me.  The phone comes with Google Assistant but so far I haven't been able to do anything really useful with that feature so don't really see the point for me, but for those of you who have Smart everythings, this would be a great feature.","images":[],"asin":"B08R5HWDZW","parent_asin":"B08R5HWDZW","user_id":"AGWLAWW4OS2OTL6XWFDAXR5ACS2A","timestamp":1611620271352,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":335,"phone_score":-0.5744396448,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":-0.5744396448,"price_score":-0.5744396448,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.5744396448,"features_score":-0.5744396448,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.5744396448,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":-0.5744396448,"size_score":0.0}

The screens are fairly snappy most of the time but for a quad core, it's not as fast as a dual core that I had before.  The call quality is subpar as well.  Inserting 2 SIM cards would seem like an easy task, but not here.  I still haven't totally figured out how to insert the second SIM and there is nothing in the 8 page manual on the SIM cards.  With heavy use, the battery might last 5 hours; I could almost watch the battery meter dropping.  I bought this thing for texting and that's about all it's good for.  You get what you pay for, it's a $100 phone.  Not recommended unless you have a teenager who loses a phone every week.<br \/><br \/>After 2 days of ownership I'm returning this phone.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Bye bye Motorola","text":"So for the past 5 years, all of my phones have been Motorola. Started with the g4 and then my x4 (which I loved). Both lasted me two years and worked well for heavy use. I had such a good experience that I even bought my family members Motorola phones over the years.<br \/><br \/>Well no longer. This phone has made me lose all of my love for the brand. I bought in April and by July the charging port was broken and battery could barely last a work day. Customer service couldn't tell me if limited warranty would cover it unless I sent it to them. The past two phones survived drops daily with no cracks on the screen but this phone barely lasted a few months before breaking completely after dropping it only a couple feet off the ground. Software would mess up a lot as well, phone would shut off for no reason at times. The phone was amazing those first 3 months but not worth it for that.<br \/><br \/>So yeah, good bye Motorola, glad I can use the money I was setting aside for the Razr on something different.","images":[],"asin":"B082BFKK4L","parent_asin":"B082BFKK4L","user_id":"AHQQCHN6IDOW4BJ4CGFTZDFLH4SA","timestamp":1610645455082,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":194,"phone_score":0.6294152737,"battery_score":0.6294152737,"screen_score":0.6294152737,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.6294152737,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.6294152737,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Awesome little phone","text":"First, the most amazing thing about the phone is its size!  This is the smallest phone I have ever seen, and the fact that it includes a camera, bluetooth, and pda functionality is simply stunning. Reception was awesome with T-Mobile.  Even in my apartment where Sprint and AT&amp;T barely work, everything was solid during an hour long conversation and the person could hear me loud and clear.  They could even hear me putting away dishes!  I really liked the joystick-based navigation, which made browsing through menus easy and precise.  The camera was average, about the same as Sanyo 8100.<br \/>There are a few negatives that keep this phone just short of a 5 star rating.  Probably the biggest is lack of speakerphone, which I found surprising for a $200 phone.  I guess they're assuming you'll go for the wireless headset, but for me, speakerphone is a convenience I just can't do without.  I felt the phone was almost too small at first, difficult to keep in your hand and easy to press the wrong buttons, but was able to adjust in a few days.  The biggest problem for me though was the lack of the standard &quot;call&quot; and &quot;end&quot; keys.  Placing and ending calls was easy enough to figure out, but getting out of the internet requires bringing up the &quot;more&quot; menu and selecting exit.  I kept having to remind myself of this procedure.  I should note I didn't get to work with the pda features much or try syncing with my computer, as installing the software required Microsoft Outlook, which I don't have.<br \/>All and all, a great little phone.  If you want something small and light and don't mind not having a speakerphone, I would definately recommend.","images":[],"asin":"B0000AGRYX","parent_asin":"B0000AGRYX","user_id":"AHBD3DLCNMEYTEPYXZHFJG4DVMLA","timestamp":1071393819000,"helpful_vote":4,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":289,"phone_score":0.9088246822,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.9088246822,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9088246822,"mobile_score":0.9088246822,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.9088246822}

Within a month of buying this phone brand-new, it started shutting itself off.  This a major problem since this is my only phone.  It also freezes a lot and you have to take out the battery to re-start it.  I drop calls all the time and have a funny noise that sounds sort of like an atomic bomb in the background of most conversations.  I also hear myself a lot through this phone.  The weird antenna thing has started to seperate and very recently, within the last month, my screen has gone out so I can't see what I am dialing.  I have only owned this phone for a year, this combined with the fact that these problems are consistent between owners of the phone is the reason why I gave it one star.<br \/><br \/>Now, people ask me why I didn't get a new one since the problems started within a few weeks of buying it.  I called Cingular and they admitted that it sounded like I bought a phone with a 'software problem.'  You think?  Then they told me that they were going to mail me a refurbished one in place of the one I bought.  I paid FULL PRICE for a brand-new phone that turned out to be a broken piece of crap and the only thing they offered is to send me a refurbished phone, a.k.a. someone else's broken piece of crap.  Way to keep your customers guys, I have been with Cingular for three years.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"I like it more than my smartphone!","text":"I got this phone 2 days early!<br \/><br \/>OK. First off, I must elucidate some facts. This phone has some history behind it. The original Sidekick LX 2009(PV300) was discontinued initially in 2010. It was re-released in two forms: The Mobilicity Mobiflip(Sharp PV300G) in late 2010 and the Cincinnati Bell Sharp Jump (PV300GC\/PV300GR)in 2011.<br \/><br \/>I received the PV300GR. This is not the ORIGNAL(nor does it come in the original black box), yet, it is a modified version that doesn't include the Catalog, AIM\/Yahoo\/Live IM clients, the browser, or the Email client. Instead, there is a generic IM application(I guess you could use any handle\/service you want), Opera Mini(an EXCELLENT browser); the Catalog and Email client have no replacements.<br \/><br \/>The misconception arises with people saying this phone can't access the Internet. The truth is: The original Sidekick can't, nor can the Mobiflip because they lack the option to change the network APN. The Sharp Jump does have this option, meaning you can change the APN, thus you can get online.(There is a caveat: The 3G bands are 1700\/2100, so you can only get 3G with T-Mobile, or any MVNO that uses T-Mobile like Simple Mobile and Straight Talk. Otherwise, you'll revert to GRPS\/EDGE for data, like I do on AT&T.) This also goes for Multimedia Messaging, so long as you know and change the MMS gateways.<br \/><br \/>As a phone, it functions very well. I can hear callers clearly, and they have no problem hearing me. However, to me, it seems that there is a slight echo whenever I speak. Also, the ringer is not terribly loud. It's enough if you're close to it, but you probably won't hear it if it's two rooms away.<br \/><br \/>As a messaging device, it's awesome. The keyboard is very spacious, but a little shallow: the buttons don't have a lot of give. The text messaging and multimedia messaging inboxes are seperate, and that's nice. There's no threaded messaging in these applications, nor is there a lot of space in either(100 messages on device and 30 on SIM for texting; 2MB total for Multimedia messaging). There is an auto delete function for both, so that's a means of management for heavy texters.<br \/><br \/>As a browser, it's OK. Obviously, browsing would be better on a smartphone, but Opera Mini does a commendable job of rendering pages through Opera's compression servers(helps save money for those who browse per kilobyte). Text entry is a snap with the keyboard.<br \/><br \/>This device also has a 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microSDHC slot(I think it'll take up to 32GB; I have a 16GB card and it works fine). The media player functions great.  You can access it wherever you may be on the phone by pressing the Jump and Done buttons at the same time. However, getting video to play on the device is a troublesome task. It says it supports MP4 and 3GP, but all the files I've thrown at it were not supported. I'll have to try a different video codec and report back...<br \/><br \/>The customization options are fair enough. You can choose one of four themes for the main screen(I found means of sideloading themes, but that doesn't work for this phone. A slight bummer.) You have plenty of choice for ringtones, but to set them, you must go into the Phone, Text Messaging, and Multimedia Messaging applications to set each kind of alert. You can import ringtones from Multimedia messages(once you set it up), but they don't have the custom light patterns like the default ringtones. Instead, the moodlights flash to the bassline and the trackball cycles the color spectrum.<br \/><br \/>The camera will do in a pinch, just not inside. If you are inside trying to take a photo, make sure to have some lights on to begin with. I haven't messed with shooting video, but seeing as it only shoots up to QVGA, I personally wouldn't bother.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I have to give this phone a 5\/5. It's a great device for those that just message a lot, or need the basics. You want apps, go get a smartphone(Honestly, you really won't be missing much... heh.) I'll monitor the comments for anyone who also happens to receive the Sharp PV300GR and who want help to set up the settings for the Internet and Multimedia Messaging.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: 8\/7\/12:I've figured out how to place Themes and Videos on the device.<br \/>Videos are best encoded in 3GP format, at a resolution of 480*272 with the H.263 video codec and the AAC audio codec. You can just paste them anywhere on the drive.<br \/>Themes are created as such(NOTE: YOU NEED A MEMORY CARD FOR THIS):<br \/>1. Plug your phone into your PC with the USB cable.<br \/>2. Access the phone's drive and create a new folder called Themes.<br \/>3. For each Theme, you must have all defined elements noted in a text file, titled theme. A simple one can be made as such:<br \/><br \/>string Name(en_US) (Place the theme name here, must be the same name as the folder)<br \/>bitmap ring-background (Place the name of the photo you want as the background here, including the file type, ie: neon.jpg or neon.png. I HIGHLY recommend using a 854x480 photo)<br \/>bitmap ring-folder-background (Can be the same as above, or a different photo. Again, follow the same rules for bitmap ring-background.)<br \/><br \/>4. Place the theme.txt file and the photos in the same folder. Title the folder the same as the theme name.(If you set the string Name(en_US) as Neon, then the folder MUST ALSO be titled Neon.)<br \/>5. Place the folder in the Themes folder.<br \/>6. Unplug your phone from the PC and give it a few moments to read your card. From the main screen, press Menu and go down to Themes. Your theme should show up below the built in four.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 11\/9\/12: I am using this phone with Simple Mobile, and I have 3G(!) internet access.<br \/>Their APN is simply(heh) simple. No password or username.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6165DoakHGL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6165DoakHGL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6165DoakHGL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T9V9dZNdL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T9V9dZNdL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71T9V9dZNdL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71ib9T1M5YL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71ib9T1M5YL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71ib9T1M5YL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"},{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71r1WDghvWL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71r1WDghvWL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71r1WDghvWL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B004ECRMH4","parent_asin":"B004ECRMH4","user_id":"AGX5NPYLCMSBTLKUQRWLNQRTOS2A","timestamp":1344206145000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":1005,"phone_score":0.7033700943,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.7033700347,"camera_score":0.7033700943,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.7033700347,"service_score":0.7033700943,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.7033700347,"device_score":0.7033700943,"memory_score":0.7033700347,"app_score":0.7033700943,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.7033700347,"size_score":0.0}

Also, the UMIDIGI is not supported by AT&T, therefore their tech support will not help troubleshoot.  UMIDIGI and any other non-U.S. company that manufactures cell phones (we are having this same issue with a V-Mobile) should consider approaching AT&T about being placed on their supported-phones list so that AT&T can help troubleshoot.

But kept it regardless because I knew updates we're coming.  This is after the updates, and I gotta say, I am very impressed so far.<br \/>Pros:. Gaming on this phone, with games that are 120 hz compatible are simply gorgeous.  Scrolling in itself on social media, or just on the home screen is super smooth.  Battery is a huge plus!  Definitely lasts a long time, even with moderate use.  Phone quality much improved, and a volume booster button was added.  Makes a good difference.  Camera does actually take great pictures during the day.  The fingerprint sensor works flawlessly, and I love the positioning of it.  Speakers sound amazing for a phone.  Can hear the sounds coming from different directions.<br \/>Cons: camera doesn't take great pictures at night.  Doesn't make the camera bad.  Not as much bells and whistles as the new Samsung phones.<br \/><br \/>Some other things I don't see mentioned alot.  I've seen some reviews complaining about the type of gorilla glass used.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"WORST PHONE EVER - 0 STARS","text":"Do not buy this phone. This is my third (and last) Treo Palm in the last eight months. The phone will be fine for a while (except for dropping calls at least once a day and not getting reception inside my house) and then, after a few months, the many design flaws and problems assert themselves:<br \/>* On my current phone, the battery and\/or phone overheated constantly to the point where I could smell something burning.<br \/>* The error message says the free data storage space is low and some data could not be saved. I looked for a way to delete some data off the phone, but I can't find a way to do it (not user friendly).<br \/>* The phone would never hot sync the calendar data.<br \/>* Another phone would freeze up, and I would have to reset it constantly. It then crashed and continually reset itself over and over again. I had to take the battery out. There was no way to retrieve any data from this phone.<br \/>* Another phone also always froze, and the email stopped working.<br \/><br \/>Worse than the phone, however, was Verizon customer \"service.\" I went to the store, and after standing in a long line, I was told to call customer service to get a new phone sent (if you ever do get this phone, BE SURE to get the warranty plan that sends you a new phone every time the Treo craters, because it will - often). About five or six days later the phone arrived. I called customer service, explaining that my hot sync didn't work, and they said, no problem, take it to the store to have them transfer the data. I took the new and old phone to the store, stood in another long line, and they said they could only transfer the contact info, but not the calendar (another Treo design flaw). They said to call customer service to get the calendar to sync.<br \/><br \/>When I got home, I spent three hours on the phone with a tech. After I told her I wanted to hot sync the phone, and that I had crucial calendar data backed up on my laptop's Palm desktop, she had me download new software and delete the old software. This ended up deleting all my laptop's backup data (including medical history, work billing information, and other important calendar info) - and restoration of the old software only ended up corrupting it - and the hot sync deleted EVERY BIT OF CALENDAR DATA off of my old Treo! No problem, she said, all that data is backed up on Outlook. I looked in Outlook, and my 700P does NOT back up to Outlook - another design flaw. (The Windows-based 700W does, and it's probably better than the 700P for this reason. She probably assumed all Treos backed up to Outlook.) Because my hot sync never worked, and because the tech support deleted all my data, I now have no record of any past or upcoming appointments.<br \/><br \/>I went to the store to replace it with a Blackberry, but the Treo data won't transfer to it, and the Blackberry wouldn't hold my 1,200 business contacts, so I'm stuck. If I can't retrieve the data from my computer or backup, it may be worth the $175 contract termination fee to switch to a different provider in order to keep the Treo and its contact data. In the meantime, wish I could find a great phone that's a good PDA and email device too....","images":[],"asin":"B000G2R0EQ","parent_asin":"B000G2R0EQ","user_id":"AHRKIR6Y2RKD7JHS5PCPUNCBNKIA","timestamp":1183722802000,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":592,"phone_score":-0.9561614394,"battery_score":-0.9561614394,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.9561614394,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.9561614394,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9561614394,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

For those having signal issues, look up how to enable VOLTE, then make sure your phone is only connecting to NR\/LTE - I would paste links in here, but they would be removed anyway. The articles are out there, and they work. You'll have to remember to enable VOLTE as this phone wants to default to connecting to 3G to make voice calls. That's why Cricket and AT&T won't support this phone because they're both scrapping their 3G networks sometime next year. It seems counterintuitive that making it so the phone WON'T connect to the 3G network would give you a better, more stable connection- but it does.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Pantech Pursuit","text":"I received this phone several months ago as a Christmas gift\/replacement for my (very) outdated old flip phone. My initial reaction was that the Pantech Pursuit was quite a nice little phone; fairly stylish, slide-out QWERTY keyboard, nicely designed, and up-to-date. After a few weeks of use however, I quickly realized that that was where the positive qualities end. So what makes this phone such a bomb? Let me tell you.<br \/><br \/>*Poor Call Quality<br \/>Now I don't know if it's due to the poor reception issues that seem to plague this phone (I often have \"0\" bars of service inside my own house, and I live in an average suburban area), or because the touch screen is so sensitive (perhaps my cheek inadvertently hits the 'end call' button when the phone is up against my face), but making calls with this device is a real test of my patience. After dialing the number, all the phone will do is ring a few times (or sometimes not at all), before simply going back to the home screen. I try again, with the same result. And again. And again. This morning, it took me six attempts to call my dentist's office to schedule an appointment. Absolutely unacceptable. There is simply no excuse for a phone being unable to perform the very task it was invented for.<br \/><br \/>*Poor Texting Abilities<br \/>Let's face it: texting seems to be the fastest growing preferred means of communication nowadays. And especially for those in the working world (or even just those of us who like to keep in touch quickly and efficiently), communication is extremely important. This phone, put simply, is worthless for this means. Very often, my text messages do not go through. I simply receive a message saying \"Sending to so-and-so failed, saved to outbox\". What use is this to me? I don't want my messages saved, I want them SENT, like a phone is SUPPOSED to do. I have to turn the phone off and back on, and that usually (but not always) gets it to send the message through. Extremely tedious and annoying, especially when I have to do this multiple times per day. I'm not talking only a handful of messages not going through, I'm talking somewhere around 50%.<br \/>An additional note on this subject is that this phone's memory capacity is also exceptionally poor; it only holds about 170 text messages in your inbox. Which means if you are anything like me, or the majority of people these days, you will be deleting messages constantly.<br \/><br \/>*Poor Internet Capability<br \/>When I pay extra for a data plan, I expect that data plan to include full, capable internet abilities. This phone however, falls far short. The internet is slow...and I mean slow as in dial-up slow, and often, pages will not load at all. Many don't display properly, and all are extremely hard to navigate. There's no way to make pages bigger. I cannot check my e-mail, conduct transactions (such as via amazon), or even browse my favorite websites. Put simply, the Internet capability (or lack thereof) on this device is so poor, it's almost not even worth having.<br \/><br \/>*Poor Camera Quality<br \/>The camera on this phone is simply and utterly worthless. You cannot take a photo of anything or anyone unless the subject is as still as a frozen statue. If you are trying to take a self-picture, and you move only a hair, it will be nothing but a blur. Images are very low quality, grainy, and there is nothing you can do about it. Kodak moments will simply just have to come and go, because with this phone, there is no way to capture them. This is simply the worst excuse for a camera that I have ever seen in a phone.<br \/><br \/>*Dysfunctional Touch Screen<br \/>As another reviewer put it, the touch screen often can't seem to decide whether it wants to be too sensitive, or completely unresponsive altogether. It seems to have no trouble ending my calls with the slightest accidental touch of the 'end call' button, yet when I'm trying to navigate through the menu screens, it does nothing at all. Compared with my iPod touch (the screen of which is always exceptionally responsive), which I'd owned before, this was a major, major letdown.<br \/><br \/>*Useless Applications<br \/>Trying to navigate through the menus on this phone is a nightmare. As if the dreadful touch screen wasn't bad enough, there are dozens of useless applications to plow through on top of it. Trying to list them all would be pointless, it would be easier to list the ones I DO use than to count out all the ones I don't. This wouldn't be such a problem if there was some way to get rid of all the ones that are just space wasters. Maybe then it would free up space for things I DO need, like some extra MEMORY for my text messages like they should have had in the first place.<br \/>On a side note, the phone is really not customizable at all. There are only a few (like about five) tacky background selections, none of which are particularly appealing.<br \/><br \/>*Lack of Game\/App Capabilities<br \/>The \"games\" that come with this phone are a joke. They're all useless, thirty-second demos, none of which are entertaining. And unlike with the iPhone, where you can easily access many thousands of apps and games, including a wide array of free ones, there is no such capability with this phone. So if you're one of those people that also likes your phone to double as a mini game center and keep you entertained on long trips, plane rides, or simply during downtime, you're out of luck with this one.<br \/><br \/>In conclusion, to say that I am disappointed with this phone would be a massive understatement. It fell far below even my lowest expectations of what a phone should be, and I would never recommend this model to anyone. I have had all I can take, and will be either upgrading to an iPhone, or opting for the early termination fee and going on a different plan, with a different phone. I will not tolerate this piece of garbage for another year and a half. Take my advice, do not purchase this phone.","images":[],"asin":"B003P2VJUK","parent_asin":"B003P2VJUK","user_id":"AFBIVQLAPKPDT5ULYFGM7BPP2ZAQ","timestamp":1308185255000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":1056,"phone_score":-0.6722072363,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.6722072959,"camera_score":-0.6722072363,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.6722072959,"apps_score":-0.6722072363,"service_score":-0.6722072959,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.6722072959,"memory_score":-0.6722072363,"app_score":-0.6722072959,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

On march 16 2020 called customer support ,phone would not send or received pictures, employee named Philipi said was not phone ,but my carrier (consumer cellular).Several calls later carrier said was problem with phone.

On May 21 2020 , phone would not turn on, called customer support , we tried several things, nothing worked. After several day of problem attempts, Sue (employee) said would replace phone and would ship new phone on May 28 2020. Waited till June 11 2020, no phone.

The screen that is \"scratch resistant\" is now all scratched up due to how slick the phone is. It slide off of my nightstand in the middle of the night and out of my hands during the day, I recommend getting a case that has a little more traction to it. The phone also constantly crashes on me, at lease 5 times a week. And I'm not sure why, but if I say \"okay google\" there is an issue with google using my mic. It asks me to to repeat \"okay google\" a few times but when I try to do that it says that google is unable to open my mic. I checked googles permission and they have permission to use my mic. Maybe it is because it is an amazon exlusive, I thought, so I tried to set it up so that I can just call on alexa but she is only able to be used when I click a button. So if my hands are full, I'm out of luck. And just recently, the phone deleted half of my contacts that were saved on my sd card. If they were on my sd card, I have no clue how or why I would wake up woth half of them gone but that is the most irritating thing of all. Definitely not buying an amazon exclusive phone again and probably not an LG either.","images":[],"asin":"B07D3QKRW1","parent_asin":"B07D3QKRW1","user_id":"AGZLH4UF4WDW3YDUGC45CYLW622A","timestamp":1558989227103,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":264,"phone_score":-0.9068644047,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.9068644047,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":-0.9068644047,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.9068644047,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I had no trouble importing contacts, etc from another basic phone - just stored to SD card and imported everything in.  set-up took about an hour (on the phone with tracfone).  that was frustrating, but it is what it is...  I suppose it took about an hour when I signed up for the original contract.  not really much else to say here; just a fine basic basic phone for answering the phone, getting a text, etc, but that's about it.  clarity is fine.  Having a decent sized screen is much better than the small screens on comparably priced flip phones.  heck, for $5, and a $20 card for 180 minutes and 90 days of service, that's great...","images":[],"asin":"B00LA7IH7U","parent_asin":"B00LA7IH7U","user_id":"AGCNOCLNABD5TW2BMFLQFUC6ZGUA","timestamp":1428516478000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":221,"phone_score":0.8081835508,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.8081835508,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.8081835508,"phones_score":0.8081835508,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.8081835508,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.8081835508,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.8081835508}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"UPDATE 3\/18\/20 FEELS LIKE A NEW PHONE AGAIN!","text":"***DISCLAIMER I DID NOT BUY THIS OFF AMAZON BUT ON ASUS'S WEBSITE***<br \/><br \/>Quick summary of old review: Bought phone, used for 2 months and then the flip camera died and was left hanging (pic provided). Nothing would fix it, not even if you were to calibrate it, tap it twice or anything. The motor was dead in such a short period of time.<br \/><br \/>The customer service that I reached from their website was originally helpful, I did mess up by not realizing their shipping label ($15) expires after 5 days of opening. When I wanted to print it I couldn't. I tried to contact CS again to buy the label from them, because I was having a hard time (said RMA was already created and I couldn't buy it directly from the website). I needed a new RMA.  A rep then asked me if I could send them some video\/pics because the issue I was complaining about could be a physical issue\/defect\/whatever and that he could show the pics to the engineers. The answer I received was to reformat my phone or reset my phone (useless).  I was going back and forth with them for almost like 1.5 months and that made me unable to get my camera fixed and I wanted to use the camera to take pictures for my trip in February. The camera was a huge selling point for me and that fell short so soon. I was extremely displeased with everything until I saw a comment from Lane who had left a comment on my review but I didn't see it in time. :'(<br \/><br \/>Edit 3\/5\/20:<br \/>I am upping the stars for my review because of Lane, who contacted me in the comments. I had an extremely hard time with the customer service team that I contacted through their website, but Lane was amazing. Response time, professionalism and everything made me feel way more confident with Asus as a company and the products they offer. I didn't give a 5 star yet because I am going to wait for my fixed phone and will update once I receive it.<br \/><br \/>3\/18\/20: I just got my phone back today and the camera is no longer hanging out! Turns out the motor was faulty and they fixed it for me. I did notice it got stuck at the same spot when I tried to take a selfie but then the camera just automatically retracted after a few seconds because it detected abnormal movement! I swear my heart dropped when I saw it but felt relieved seeing that it wasn't permanent. I hope it is not going to become permanently loose again (the horror!). But other than that it is a fully functioning phone again! FINALLY!<br \/><br \/>Thank you Lane for lending me a hand! I am really impressed and this expeirence made me more confident about  owning this product knowing that ASUS does care about their customers. I had an issue with the repair center initially and Lane helped me out tremendously and made sure that my phone got repaired as soon as possible. I am so happy! :)","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/717BZeFM6UL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/717BZeFM6UL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/717BZeFM6UL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B07VZX9CRV","parent_asin":"B07VZX9CRV","user_id":"AF52RVV5IA7DMQZUYBOZEFCBKVRQ","timestamp":1576099352211,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":524,"phone_score":0.5246578455,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.5246578455,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.5246578455,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.5246578455,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

Phone is so painfully slow, have no idea why a product like this is made.<br \/><br \/>Nearly every operation is 2-3 second delay.  Attempting to unlock phone is an exercise in frustration... or far more patience than I have.  Good luck opening settings like wifi or bluetooth, launching an app... like the camera.  Response is so delayed, you'll think the touch wasn't recognized and try again, often making it worse.  And what's most unforgivable, attempting to answer a call with sluggishness is an absolutely crap shoot.  On several occasions I've been UNABLE to answer a call, simply because the phone doesn't have the power to ring and recognize button press.<br \/><br \/>And to be clear, the utter lack of performance isn't due to extra apps or simply a bad phone.

PRICE, I bought mine at ebay.com (used like new) for only $150, original HP leather bag included + box and all original accesories sealed.<br \/>2. PERFORMANCE, the overall phone's performance is remarkable, It is a lot faster than the P990i and surfing on the web via wifi is smooth. All pages open easily even email accounts, I have four differente email accounts and all of them open quite a bit fast with no jams.<br \/>3.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"It's alright.","text":"The phone isn't great, but it works well enough for what I need. For now. I just wanted a slim phone to replace my razr v3 that wasn't overly chintzy and had decent battery life. I didn't want a smart phone; all that extra stuff isn't useful to me. I wouldn't carry a phone at all if I weren't required to have one.<br \/><br \/>Problems I've encountered:<br \/><br \/>First, I cannot disable the touch functionality on the front screen, so even with it programmed to lock, from time to time it'll go into camera mode and take pictures of my pocket or start browsing the web on its own. The leather pockets on my jacket are \"close enough\" for the phone to think I'm fiddling with it. This is especially after I miss a call - the front screen does not lock itself until I clear the missed call message and it will gladly browse and take pictures until then.<br \/><br \/>Second, the internet cannot be shut off on the phone. I don't have a data plan, so any pocket browsing that takes place comes at a very steep premium. I've read that I have to go through AT&T to shut off data completely, but the plan isn't in my name so I can't even do that.<br \/><br \/>Third, which I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or it it's a problem with all of the razr v9 models, the battery door on the back does not stay on. The bottom two clips grab nicely, but there is no way for the top clips to attach to the phone, so the top just hangs loosely and from time to time the door just comes off. One of these times, the bottom clips are going to break off and the door will be permanently useless. At least the battery is in there tight enough that it doesn't shut off my phone when the door comes off.<br \/><br \/>My razr v3 didn't have any of these problems. If I could take the battery out of this v9x and put it back in that, I'd use my old phone again instead. It's also quite clear that this new phone won't hold up for the six year span I've had that v3. The battery on that started to swell, so I figured it was time to update.

Camera is fantastic needs some improvement though by software update. Battery life is tooooooo loooooong. Lasts for 3days of Moderate usage.<br \/>Cons: speaker is like a joke. It sounds like a cheap Chinese radio.<br \/>The most important thing i'd like to mention that xiaomi said now they have a new improved vibration motor for better haptic feedback but  on that one is worse than ever. . Even for more now they have removed the option to adjust vibration intensity  like soft , medium to hi tapping on the screen. So there is no way to adjust haptic feedback strength.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"More rugged than a hard boiled egg, Sim Processor shot shortly after 6 months of use.","text":"*Update* This thing is a POS.  My phone has essentially been a paperweight for months with no real reason why aside from the software\/firmware is crappy to begin with.  There\u2019s nothing \u201crugged\u201d about this phone.  If it can\u2019t withstand a SAHM with 2 electronically-Savy but screen limited toddlers, I can\u2019t imagine it ever doing well on a hike, rock climb, mountain climb, etc that it claims to be great for.  I do NOT recommend this, and customer service has been nonexistent from the start.  Don\u2019t waste your money.... and I am not one to typically write a bad review.  Just being 100% honest.<br \/><br \/>I bought this phone for two reasons... 1) to have a phone withstand my toddler girls and I heir constant curiosity with electronics that has resulted in 2 shattered phone screens (RIP Huawei Mate SEs \ud83d\ude13) and 2) to have a no frills phone that has enough storage capability to take and keep one of pictures, because my animals and kids are adorable.  Added bonus was that I could take underwater pictures... cool!<br \/><br \/>I guess I got what I paid for.  I use Mint Mobile and the phone is essentially a paperweight if I am not connected to WiFi.  My reception in my area with the Huaweis using Mint Mobile was much better.  Takes forever to load a webpage and I have to turn my phone on and off if transitioning from WiFi to data unsafe.  All of my Mint Mobile settings are correct and what they need to be.  If not on WiFi, I don\u2019t receive messages and texts until I restart the phone.  Super annoying as a stay at home mom on the go.<br \/><br \/>We also spend a lot of time outside, and lo and behold, my 4yo picked my phone up and dropped it on brushed concrete (no pebbles sticking up) and the screen has a deep peck in the glass already that now renders the waterproof feature useless.  I had the phone a whopping 2 or 3 weeks and this already happens.  Not as rugged as I had hoped, and I wasn\u2019t really even asking for much as far as ruggedness goes.  I\u2019m thankful that the screen didn\u2019t completely shatter, but for a rugged phone... the screen is still pretty fragile.  Now I can\u2019t return it and am just kind of stuck with it.  Phone repair places in my area only fix the big brand screens and prices are astronomical to fix screens anyway, to the point you\u2019re better off buying a new phone (if you haven\u2019t caught on, I\u2019ve been through this before).<br \/><br \/>Sound quality is good, Bluetooth works much better than my old Huaweis as far as connecting to my car and such.  I miss having a fingerprint reader, but the newest version of King Kong phones have them.  The load times are seriously so slow on this phone though even on WiFi.  I would have probably sent this back had my toddler not already wreaked her havoc on it.<br \/><br \/>Also, as others have said, the camera is pretty terrible.  The only good ones taken are those taken outside.  Thankfully, that\u2019s where we spend most of our time, but frustrating any other time.  If I had to do it over again, I\u2019d probably splurge a little more to get the newest version or go with a different phone altogether.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/8167JXv+1yL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/8167JXv+1yL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/8167JXv+1yL.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B07MFT4YQJ","parent_asin":"B07MFT4YQJ","user_id":"AHK76SUUL5BB32L46ERVEQHRCJ3A","timestamp":1558978765377,"helpful_vote":13,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":563,"phone_score":-0.8804534078,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.880453527,"camera_score":-0.8804534078,"price_score":-0.880453527,"phones_score":-0.8804534078,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.880453527,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.8804534078,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":-0.880453527,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.8804534078,"wifi_score":-0.880453527,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"a steal","text":"this phone is a steal. with google voice, I make phone calls and send\/receive texts over wifi (using the hangouts dialer) but can resort to regular voice\/text when I don't have wifi and\/or data. Supposedly these tracfone androids don't have data roaming, but this hasn't been an issue yet for me (I've had 3G coverage nearly everywhere I have cell service so far, and I live in the middle of nowhere northern CA). A couple of minor annoyances: syncing my google contacts to the phone resulted in a mess, so I erased those and used bluetooth to send contacts from my dumbphone to the fuel and turned off auto syncing for my contacts. Also, there are a ton of apps I don't need\/want and I haven't looked into disabling or deleting them but I think other reviewers have posted links for useful info on this. I've been using a google voice number and and dumb phone for about a year, but I realized I would save minutes if I could make calls directly from the phone over VOIP (vs using my computer, which always feels weird). So now I don't burn through minutes unless I'm away from wifi, and I've got everything integrated into the phone, rather than always having to check texts and messages on the computer. Receiving calls with hangouts is pretty weird...it seems like the phone and hangouts are battling over which will take the call...tips would be appreciated if anyone else uses GV\/hangouts to answer calls. Regardless, for $58 and probably around $10 a month, I don't know of a cheaper smartphone plan. So glad tracfone is getting somewhat up to date smartphones.","images":[],"asin":"B00NVQ19NW","parent_asin":"B00NVQ19NW","user_id":"AG5RU4MINTQ4B2BJDKY5WKD5VL7A","timestamp":1414030852000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":277,"phone_score":0.6484821439,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.6484821439,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.6484821439,"service_score":0.6484821439,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.6484821439,"wifi_score":0.6484821439,"cell_score":0.6484821439,"size_score":0.0}

The power\/sleep button is on top and thats fine if you carry it in a holster om your belt, if your like me and its always in your pocket be prepared to hear the startup tone often. I bought this phone on its launch day (10\/2013) and I really like it or I should say liked it for about 8 months then the battery started to decline.  As of today (8\/18\/2014) the battery only lasted 6 1\/2 hours. The overall experience with the HTC desire 601 is one experience I liked, I say liked because I've ordered a new phone from VM. These mid range phone are really only good for a year or so, so understand you'll end up with a new phone in about 8-12 months no matter what you get.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"If you need a decent battery life- this is wrong phone to buy!","text":"This may be the first unhappy review I've written on Amazon...but here goes: I 'upgraded' to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems (don't all Treo 650's suffer from that within a year's usage?). I loved my Treo 650 despite the well-known audio problems that arise, so I expected something equivalent to the 650 when I upgraded. But what I got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life. I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled and every \"trick\" Palm and other users suggest to extend battery performance is utilized. Add to this the fact that Palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and they have made it next to impossible to reach them to complain about this, you don't have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper \"smartphone\" on the market recently. Sorry Palm, I loved you for the Treo 650 and was willing to live with some glitches, but a horrible battery life on the 680 is not something easy to tolerate.  So all I can say is pretty \"stupid\" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before planning to exit the \"smartphone\" market? [Despite the prior reviews on this page that were so glowing, anyone who is doubtful of my complaint on battery life, or think that its isolated to just a defective phone here and there, I suggest that you please do a search on the internet before buying this phone, and read the numerous blogs out there on this very same complaint!)<br \/><br \/>P.S.: search under these words exactly on Amazon: \"palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked)\" to read other reviews of this phone stating similar battery life complaints. Whether locked (meaning tied to any one company like Verizon or Cingular) or not, a Palm Treo 680 is still the same Palm product.","images":[],"asin":"B000KPY83K","parent_asin":"B000KPY83K","user_id":"AEQOKRNBQ6TVHJQBP6JHSBKCOWHA","timestamp":1167944065000,"helpful_vote":28,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":375,"phone_score":-0.7839778662,"battery_score":-0.7839779258,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":-0.7839778662,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":-0.7839779258,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.7839778662,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

It doesn't freeze like some of the other cheaper phones and it is pretty quick. It will play most games and will be able to handle browsing the web seamlessly. The touch screen is very responsive. The battery life is awesome. It has a pretty nice looking, bright screen. I paid $100 for the phone and it was a good price then.<br \/><br \/>CONS: Only 8 GB of internal storage, with no MicroSD slot or any option to add more offline memory to the device. This is all there is for the android operating system, the tons of apps you don't need\/do need, pictures and music.<br \/><br \/>A question on here asked if there is bloatware on the device and some of the answers said no. This is false to the fullest extent. You have whether you like it or not the original android apps which aren't too bad in my opinion; calculator, 2 calendar apps, camera, clock, 2 email apps, phone ect. Then you have google apps; drive, gmail, google settings, google+, google maps, play books, people, play store, quick office, hangouts ect which are less useful. Then you have the apps that are probably good to have when you get your phone; alert, migrate, setup, verizon tones, VZNavigator ect. Then you have the apps that just don't make any sense NFL mobile, play movies & TV, play newstand, ect. In an ideal world, the phone would come with a list of apps that are necessary;phone, contacts, play store ect. and we would download the apps we find useful, but that is not the case. In a less ideal world we could delete the bloatware, which again we cannot do. In the end this device does not suffice for people who want to download alot of music onto it, and play alot of apps. With this device you will have to pick and choose.<br \/><br \/>One of the ways people remove bloatware and get more access to control the phone how we like it, is unlocking the phone and gaining root access, In some cases like myself Motorola locked the bootloader and so it actually is impossible to remove bloatware at all and gain unrestricted access to something you own.<br \/><br \/>In some cases you can miss out on free google drive storage, and the storage only lasts for 2 years.<br \/><br \/>In summation; Motorola makes choices that aren't theirs to make. Even though you own the phone Motorola will choose what apps you have to have installed on your device and what apps you cannot have on your device (i.e. apps with unrestricted access to the phone). They took out the SD slot because users can use the cloud, making their customers access the internet in order to access their external storage.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"UPDATED:  AWFUL phone!!!  --->>>>>  old review:  Awesome phone. Probably the best Android phone I have ...","text":"UPDATE:  After six months, this phone has gone from hero to zero.  The battery, which is NOT REPLACEABLE, lasted about five months and then wouldn't stay charged over four hours, even after charging overnight.  Then one night, after the battery died, I powered it back up on a charger to be greeted with &#34;No SIM card&#34;.  I called Sharp warranty service and was told immediately that it had a broken SIM card holder.  I spent $6 to get it shipped to Memphis TN for repair.  At this point the phone has cost me around $156.  Two days later I got an email from Sharp with a couple of pictures of the corners of the plastic case on the phone which had cracked when I happened to drop it on a CARPETED floor once.  They said:<br \/><br \/>&#34;Sharp repair notice Physical damage on device(see below).<br \/><br \/>Fee for repair is 110.00 to have device repaired.<br \/><br \/>If you would like device repaired please reply with callback number to have credit card given.<br \/><br \/>If you would like to Decline repair please reply I Decline to have device repaired.&#34;<br \/><br \/>I immediately called them and cried foul.  I asked for an escalation and got this from the manager:<br \/><br \/>&#34;We have looked into this further and found that we will not be able to repair the device without also repairing the cosmetic damage, so the $110.00 repair estimate stands.<br \/><br \/>I can extend the warranty by 2 months as a courtesy should you decide to pay for the repair at Sharp.<br \/><br \/>Please let us know how you would like to proceed.&#34;<br \/><br \/>I emailed this manager back and asked for another escalation.<br \/><br \/>This phone is VERY fragile and obviously cannot be repaired without replacement, which is why Sharp is trying to cover their losses by asking you to buy a new phone, essentially.  Stay away from it.  It isn't worth the $6 I took to ship it to Sharp.  I will be lucky if I even get the broken device back from them.  The phone starts out good, but then starts falling apart.  I am leaving my initial review below just to see how far my regard has fallen.  It is really awful.<br \/><br \/>-------<br \/><br \/>Awesome phone.  Probably the best Android phone I have used.  I constantly get comments about how clear I sound on phone calls.  The Harmon Kardon sound is great.  None of the issue with partitions that HTC phones have.  The screen is really great, much bigger than iPhone 6, and just a little smaller than iPhone 6+, which is over $500 more expensive than this phone and has all the baggage that goes with Apple phones.  If you are on Boost, go with this phone.","images":[],"asin":"B00O15E3MQ","parent_asin":"B00O15E3MQ","user_id":"AFLJXRWDX2VFRMGMTFSVBDGD3GRA","timestamp":1421077952000,"helpful_vote":8,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":460,"phone_score":-0.9072310925,"battery_score":-0.9072310925,"screen_score":-0.9072310925,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.9072310925,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.9072310925,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.9072310925,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.9072310925,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.9072310925,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

I was intimidated in buying a smartphone because I am not tech savvy, to say the least, and do not care about apps, texting or emails. However, I do use google, which jitterbug flip phones do not have. My hesitancy was also compounded by the copious amounts of bad reviews but I thought I would give the phone a go and if I didn't like it I would return it. I have no idea why so many people have problems with the phone. I have been using it a month and have had NO issues. It is easy to navigate and the instructions are easy to follow. Customer service was IMMEDIATE and it was a no hassle experience. In fact, I was shocked that it was such a pleasant experience. Maybe I got lucky, but everything was explained quite simply. Also the screen is not hyper sensitive, like other smart phones. That is another reason I did not want to purchase a smart phone. Every time I used someone's smart phone, the screen would change without me even touching it. Very frustrating! Anyway, this one is not at all sensitive and the screen remains visible for a long time. I also like that you are not locked into any plan. It is very inexpensive. I pay about $30 a month for minutes and data.  In addition, the ring tone is loud enough for anyone to hear and it is easy to type, if you need to.Furthermore I would recommend it to anyone who feels uneasy about technology.","images":[],"asin":"B07GS1V652","parent_asin":"B07GS1V652","user_id":"AFKUKNG2ACSFVPP6K7TESP5YVDDA","timestamp":1567563236348,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":278,"phone_score":-0.7594678402,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.7594678402,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.7594678402,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":-0.7594678402,"service_score":-0.7594678402,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.7594678402,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

The odd thing is that it streams music, such as Prime Music and Pandora cleanly, but poor Bluetooth phone connection to external devices.  I use this Blu for car calls all the time, and although the phone itself has clear calling overall, the calling sound over Bluetooth connection, along with the other 2 issues I noted, makes this phone rate more of a 2 or 3 stars for me.<br \/>Please fix these issues for us Blu, so I can happily adjust my ratings.","images":[],"asin":"B07LGDF34X","parent_asin":"B07LGDF34X","user_id":"AFEZYPCSKTKRXGIJE47RASICLJVQ","timestamp":1577670692441,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":259,"phone_score":-0.7827739716,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":-0.7827739716,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.7827739716,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":-0.7827739716,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":-0.7827739716,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.7827739716,"wifi_score":-0.7827739716,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Phone!","text":"I normally never really cared for Motorola phones.  Everytime I have had them with AT&T the phone always froze and calls were always dropped.  This phone, with Cingular, is different.  I have had the phone for a little over a month now.  So far, I have yet to experience any dropped calls.  The reception is great.  The phone is beautiful.  It takes great pictures too.  The sleek design is very ideal for me.  It fits nicely in my small purses.  I do have some concerns though.<br \/><br \/>First, when I use the bluetooth headset with the phone, the phone battery lasts for only about two days.  Also, the outside monitor, on the flip, isn't nearly as clear as the picture on the inside screen of the phone.  Also, the keypad does get fingerprints easily (the phone came with a motorola cleaning thing so it really comes of easily).  I am though concerned about dropping the phone on my tile.  The phone seems really delicate.  Using the bluetooth earpiece though allows me just to take the earpiece out of my purse and walk around with that.  Remember as with all phones, to occasionally power them off to receive updates from your service provider.  This will increase the phone recpetion and prevent drop calls.<br \/><br \/>Overall,  I am extremely happy with this phone.  I encourage those who are interested in purchasing this phone to read other consumer reviews such as mine.","images":[],"asin":"B0006I2E1O","parent_asin":"B0006I2E1O","user_id":"AFV5OTFEIUB5FD7RFO6WEV4ZWK2Q","timestamp":1116780730000,"helpful_vote":11,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":239,"phone_score":-0.5458119512,"battery_score":-0.5458119512,"screen_score":-0.5458119512,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":-0.5458119512,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.5458119512,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.5458119512,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent value with minimal compromise.","text":"Bought this phone (64gb version) to replace an iPhone 6s 16gb version, wanted to try Android again (tend to ping-pong Apple and Android every other generation).<br \/><br \/>The phone is incredibly fast and has lots of internal storage. The camera also has a fast shutter and takes incredible pictures when the lighting is just right. The SIM and SD card tray is a little odd until you figure out what's going on, but once you figure it out and slide the tray back in, the phone recognized both no problem. Pretty much stock Android with a few Moto quirks (twist for camera, flick for flashlight) that don't bog down the phone like Samsung software tends to do (my old Galaxy S6). Android 7.0 is its own review, but considering my last Android was 5.0, the newer features are very welcome.<br \/><br \/>Two things I'm sure people want to know:<br \/>1 - This works on T-Mobile no issues; didn't have to call anyone or anything like that, plugged in the SIM and off I went.<br \/>2 - My version is the Prime Exclusive with lock-screen ads. Basically, the difference between this and the standard version ($60 more) is twofold: mine came with Amazon's apps pre-installed on the phone, all in their own folder and the lock-screen will almost always have an ad. If you have no notifications, it will be a full screen ad which can be swiped away; if you have notifications, it will just be another notification, always below your main notifications, that can also be swiped away. These ads don't interfere with your ability to get into your phone instantly and don't interfere with notifications or checking the time.","images":[],"asin":"B01N6NTIRH","parent_asin":"B01N6NTIRH","user_id":"AHTZDRON2OLKPJFV42DSY22EOAFA","timestamp":1491018559000,"helpful_vote":1173,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":281,"phone_score":0.824803412,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.824803412,"camera_score":0.824803412,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.824803412,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.824803412,"mobile_score":0.824803412,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.824803412,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A great deal for the money","text":"Overall, I'm really pleased with this phone.  I use it more for texting, checking work emails, and work-related security such as 2 Factor Authentication and things like network utilities.  I don't use social media at all.<br \/><br \/>I'm the kind of person that prefers to get the most bang for my buck.  I might go as far as to say I'm cheap, but when the time comes to spend money, I'm willing to do it.  To me, this phone represents a great value.  I purchased it to replace a $256 Huawei P10 Lite that I had for just over 2 years.  The Huawei always worked fine, but lately I started to notice that the battery wasn't holding the charge as long as it did, and wouldn't last 48 hours.  I'm sure I could have gotten the phone to last another year, but the time seemed right for an all-around upgrade.<br \/><br \/>I compared the 9T Pro to things like the OnePlus and the Razer 2, but each phone seemed to excel at different things.  For me, there was no clear and definitive winner in terms of performance vs screen vs camera vs weatherproofing.  But getting the battery size, performance, stereo jack, and triple-camera resolution, I opted for the 9T Pro.<br \/><br \/>The packaging is all slick and a decent presentation.  The SIM card was a little difficult to get out, and I was nervous I wasn't going to get it.  It's a dual-SIM phone, and I couldn't find a clear definition of which SIM was #1, so I just put my Mint SIM card in one and closed it up.  In a minute, I was online and my phone was restoring all my apps.  The build of the phone itself seems solid, and I don't feel like I'm holding a toy, or a brick.<br \/><br \/>It's a big, beautiful screen, with practically no bevel around it. I like the colors, and I've turned the brighness up for my old eyes and also run it in 'Dark Mode' which I find much more usable. It seems silly, but looking at my old phone with the notch now seems ridiculous.  I liked that the Huawei had the fingerprint reader on the back, but the screen is livable.  It can take a second or 2 to identify where I'm supposed to hold my thumb, but it's still quicker than typing a 4-digit code.  The phone has no branding or clear indicator on the front, so it's hard to tell if you're picking it up upside down or not.  I like that I can scan multiple fingers so I can unlock it with my left or right thumbs or pointer fingers.<br \/><br \/>I did try the face unlock feature, and it works pretty well, maybe even faster than the fingerprint scanner.  But in order to be used, it has to pop up the selfie camera, and I just didn't want that happening my mistake or a million times a day.  More on that later.<br \/><br \/>The MIUI interface isn't horrible.  Like most UI's, is really just takes getting used to before you like it.  I don't use any of the Mi software or accounts, just like I didn't use the Huawei versions, so there is a noticable amount of bloatware on the phone.  I prefer to stick with my Google account for all things.  Luckily, changing the phone to use the default apps like Chrome for the browser aren't too difficult.<br \/><br \/>Some of the newer features of Android, the phone, and MIUI are enjoyable, like the Ambient display, the icon management, app management and so on.  The phone seems more able to be customized to my liking than my previous phone, it just takes some digging.  I wound up trying several weather apps before I found one that let me put a 4x2 display of the current date and time along with the weather and the last time the weather was retreived, but that's my own personal battle.  By accident once I ran a Mi app to clean up the phone, and it put all my defaults back to the Mi apps, but again it wasn't hard to reset them to my liking.<br \/><br \/>Performance wise, I can see a real advantage compared to my older phone.  It's definitely snappier in most operations, but this typically means in regards to the UI.  The finger unlock is nearly instantaneous once you get used to wear to place your finger.  Surfing, videos, games, never seem to leave me waiting.  I won't say it's all instaneous, but I will say that the added expense for performance was worth it.<br \/><br \/>The camera performance isn't bad at all, and I like the 3 zoom levels.  I would say that performance is again better then my last phone, and photos in decent light are pretty darn presentable and printable.  I'm a bit of a snob here, so I won't be giving up my DSLR any time soon, but it's noice to have a camera that can relatively compete with some of the high-grade phone cameras out there.<br \/><br \/>Audio quality and cell service get no complaints from me.  The bluetooth and WiFi all work as expected, and it seems like the BlueTooth allowed me to walk away from my BT soundbar a little farther than my previous phone.<br \/><br \/>The selfie camera is a bit of a gimick, and might make some nervous.  As you switch to and from the selfie camera, the motorized camera pops up and down respectively.  It takes a second to pop up or close, so you don't really notice.  Quality is fine.  But it does make me nervous that it will break or start popping up while in a pocket or something.  With that said, I pretty much never take selfies (I'm not from this generation), so the selfie camera means nothing to me.<br \/><br \/>The battery is awesome, and sitting at my desk yesterday it was going down about 1% an hour.  The quick charge feature is very nice, and the wall plug that comes with it is a qiuck charge type, which is a nice bonus.  I did find it hard to locate exact specs on what chargers will give fast charging.  I believe that 27W QC4.0 charges will go 'Turbo', while 18W QC3 charges will go 'Quick', and regular USB chargers will just charge normal speed.<br \/><br \/>My biggest complaints about the phone is that I wish it were waterproof, and it keeps connecting to open WiFi networks.  The waterproof shouldn't really be a problem as I've never damaged a phone from water in 25 years.  And I assume that the WiFi option is a setting somewhere (I've found posts that indicate settings that don't exist) or just a utility app I need to install.","images":[],"asin":"B07X5SHN81","parent_asin":"B07X5SHN81","user_id":"AHEFVCNUMJGR5UOJ2EWTF3XBBUZQ","timestamp":1576767291574,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":1135,"phone_score":0.9125412107,"battery_score":0.9125412107,"screen_score":0.9125412107,"camera_score":0.9125412107,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.9125412107,"apps_score":0.9125412107,"service_score":0.9125412107,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.9125412107,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9125412107,"wifi_score":0.9125412107,"cell_score":0.9125412107,"size_score":0.9125412107}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Second phone did power up!","text":"Update: they sent another phone. It would not power on either. I freaked out. I had plugged phone up just to see if it would power and someone came to my door and so I left for the phone for about 5 minutes and on return I picked phone up and the screen flashed so I gave it 30 minutes plugged up. I figured out how to start it up, press and hold the RED Key. The receiver is too weak I can't pickup any ATT data. First time for that. I get three bars on my pixels. I think I am going to proceed with the return on this and just get a pixel 6 and just use an older phone for ruffing it. So I could not test cellular data with no bars present but my wifi works. the browser picked up CNN great, clear and sharp picture. The interface looked clean. FM radio, settings, video player, calculator, email, browser, my cricket, music, calendar, gallery, alarm, messages, camera, contacts and phone show on the two page menu. I was under the impression from the Alcatel website looking at the Quick Flip 4 that it used USB C this model does not and any car charger will need to be \"old timey\", this one also did not come with even a quick start guide, it has 998.01 MB of storage free on startup. On this model the ability to download any app from the KaiOS store does not appear to be present. So I think my assumption that this was a quickflip 4 was wrong, there are important differences, like lack of USB C and the missing KaiOS Store. Just the fact you do get an unlocked ATT\/Tmobile new generation phone is really all that is included with this. I would need to buy a car charger and a additional travel wall wart since since USB C is out. This turns out to be slightly too plain only because of just those few differences, hopefully knowing this will help you make an informed purchase decision. Oh, it will make phone calls and do texts, I did not mess with email or any app for that matter.<br \/><br \/>I bought this as a substitute phone for use when my good phone might get broke, like going fishing. When I opened the package none of the normal film was on any of the windows and the battery looked like someone used a lighter to reseal the plastic back up. In any case phone would not power up. It looked like a basic phone and that is all I wanted. I choose the send me another phone return option so by tomorrow I should know if I like it.  It did not even have a quick start guide in the box. I looked forward to giving it a shot just got my fishing license yesterday.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61feH2gAPYL._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61feH2gAPYL._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61feH2gAPYL._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B07PHTYGY7","parent_asin":"B07PHTYGY7","user_id":"AERQSX2OERHRNKOSL3O6TATWEGXA","timestamp":1650323729766,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":483,"phone_score":-0.849758029,"battery_score":-0.849758029,"screen_score":-0.849758029,"camera_score":-0.849758029,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":-0.849758029,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":-0.849758029,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":-0.849758029,"wifi_score":-0.849758029,"cell_score":-0.849758029,"size_score":0.0}

When I attempted to make an outgoing call (using a T-Mobile SIM) the device put itself into Do Not Disturb mode and the call would not complete.  I spent about an hour or so on the phone with BLU Technical Support and, after all the trouble shooting, it was determined that the unit was defective.  I returned it for an exchange.  Well, the replacement unit did *exactly* the same thing!!  I even went to the trouble of calling Tech Support again just to see if this could be solved, and it could not, so that they would have the information that this was occurring on multiple devices.  What was really weird was that one could send and receive text messages without issue as well as receiving incoming calls (and the call quality on those was very good).  You just could not make an outgoing call, period.<br \/><br \/>The technical support reps were great, really patient and diligent about taking me through each and every step for the diagnostic process (and I'm a tech geek myself, so I know whereof I speak).  I was really very pleased with the customer service I got from their technical support folks.  If the devices were as good as the technical support was this review would probably have been 4 or 5 stars, but when you have two brand new devices in a row that have the same quirky failure, and with an essential and basic function for a phone, someone's dropped the ball.<br \/><br \/>Let's hope that they get this ironed out, as I doubt very much that these two devices will be the only two that suffer from this issue.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good but not great phone","text":"I've had this phone for a few weeks now and here are my thoughts on it:<br \/>1) Activation was a breeze, to transfer my number from my previous phone to this one. It took just a few minutes.<br \/>2) It came with Android 8 but it gave the option to update to Android Pie (9.0) on the same day.<br \/>3) The fingerprint sensor lets you store more than one fingerprint. However, it sometimes takes a few tries in order to unlock your phone.<br \/>4) The call quality is really good. It's definitely an improvement from my previous phone which was an LG Premier. The sound would sometimes break up during calls on my previous phone. I don't have that problem with this phone.<br \/>5) This phone is narrower than my previous phone, but it's probably better that way since my hands are small and thin.<br \/>6) The camera is just ok at best. Nighttime pictures come out pretty awful. There's also a bit of lag when you press the shutter button. Unfortunately, that's the primary disadvantage of a budget\/midrange smartphone -- that the camera\/picture quality is just average.<br \/>7) The phone has some handy features such as the \"double chop\" to turn on the flashlight, and the double twist of the wrist to activate the camera.<br \/>8) The 32GB of internal storage is decent, and you can even format an SD card to become part of the internal storage.<br \/>9) This phone does not have NFC, which I do not use but it's good to have that feature on a phone in case one does decide to use it at some point.<br \/>10) Definitely get a case for it, as the glass back is slippery.<br \/>11) All things considered, this is an overall good phone, especially since I only paid $69.99 for it, including the $40 airtime bundle, as it was on sale during Black Friday\/Cyber Monday. Shipping was free, though it took an entire week for the phone to arrive.","images":[],"asin":"B07GC5FZGH","parent_asin":"B07GC5FZGH","user_id":"AEFEF7LXDXIXHDTAVX6A37HDDJPA","timestamp":1577391459686,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":331,"phone_score":0.930624485,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.930624485,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.930624485,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.930624485,"features_score":0.930624485,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A great replacement for a S7 phone with all the features that new Galaxy phones removed","text":"I brought this phone to replace my S7.  Straight out of the box, it set up easily. The fingerprint reader works well. The facial recognition was fast and works really well. I now have a phone that does not need to be charged every two hours. I spend a lot of time on it, usually on youtube, watching videos, and listening to music. I can go through a full day and still have a good 78% charge by bedtime.<br \/><br \/>I am not sure why people are complaining about where the phone was made. MOST ALL PHONES are made in China or Vietnam. They ALL START at this version - international, then the American phone companies add in all their crappy bloatware and lock them to their networks. It's a scam and, I believe, we are the only country that does that.<br \/><br \/>You set the phone up the same way. It has loads of languages to select. And, you're done. Nothing but a nice, clean phone. It doesn't have 5G, it's still an LTE phone (4G). Not a lot of phones currently work on the 5G network so this phone should be good for some time. Just because phone companies advertise their 5G networks on TV, doesn't mean you phone is compatible. Currently, there are a handful of phones that are 5G and not every \"5G city\" actually has \"good\" 5G service.<br \/><br \/>It comes with a charging brick in the box. However the Charger has 2 round prongs\/pins 220 VAC - Europe, Asia (not for USA,CA,Mex. unless used with adapter). I had to buy an Anker 25W fast charger to use with the phone.<br \/><br \/>The phone \ud83d\udcf1 is definitely water proof and dust proof! It even has a SD card slot for expanding storage! It has 8gb of ram and 256gb of storage! The flagship samsung galaxy s21 don't have expanding storage and it has 1 less camera! Both the front and rear cameras can record in 4k uhd at 30fps! YouTube videos can be watched in up to 4k quality which is awesome!<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a great phone for a great price.

If you want a newer phone, don't need or want the high end specs, or high end price, I would recommend this phone to you.

Anyway, a few things right off: this phone is locked to Cingular and you will have to find a UK based site to get an unlock code if you want to stray to other GSM services. The worst thing about this phone is that Cingular blocks outbound dial-up calls over USB and Bluetooth. I had hoped to use my handheld and laptop to dial-up into my computer and get internet access with out paying for a cingular plan, but they have disabled this feature. I still rate the phone a 5 because this is cingulars doing (SIM block).<br \/><br \/>Otherwise, the phone is amazing. Out of the box it is quite hard to get to your address book, but you can customize the main screen and change any of the shortcuts. The only thing lacking (which I may just not know how to do) is browsing the address book: you can't spell out contact names ... each letter you hit takes you to that part of the phone book.<br \/><br \/>This is also a very durable phone =)","images":[],"asin":"B0006I2E1O","parent_asin":"B0006I2E1O","user_id":"AESXZM6MX4C7LA7WFOGIL6HSUGAA","timestamp":1111575991000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":188,"phone_score":-0.908225894,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":-0.908225894,"camera_score":0.0,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":-0.908225894,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"So far, so good","text":"I've had this for 3-4 weeks now and it is a pleasure to use.<br \/><br \/>A very nice phone. No bloatware. Everything seems to function smoothly with Google aps in the Google universe.<br \/><br \/>FM radio works very well - great sound quality.  Other audio has good sound quality too, loud enough volume with ear phones and outer speaker can get pretty loud, too. Face recognition very fast and convenient - however, some web sites say that it is not too secure but it is secure enough for me (I don't believe I'm a target of North Korean hackers, and I don't keep sensitive\/important info on it). Fingerprint reader is finicky and hard to use - it takes many attempts for it to read the fingerprint properly. But it often is functional.<br \/><br \/>Fit\/finish\/quality is pretty good. Glass surface has a very smooth, slick feel. It comes with a cheap case but it is very useful and I'm glad I have it. The back is very slippery and also the case protects the back-facing cameras from getting scratched. There is one pop-out tray that holds that has two open positions - it holds the sim card and can hold a second sim card or an SD memory card. That tray is a bit fragile and should be handled with utmost care - improperly ejecting or inserting it could bend it and cause a serious problem. Whenever I have to do something with that tray I make sure to work in a quiet place with a clean tabletop and take my time. I would expect the top-priced phones to have higher quality for that sort of thing. I accept the fragility of that tray on this phone as a trade-off for the low cost (I paid $260 including tax and shipping).<br \/><br \/>Battery use is good.  With moderate use I could probably go 2 days without recharging.<br \/><br \/>Negative aspects or things needing improvement<br \/>* Tray for sim and SD cards fragile (as I said above).<br \/>* Just 3 buttons - volume up, volume down, power. They are all located next to each other. Often inadvertently hitting power button and waking up or putting to sleep the phone. Would be better if the volume buttons were on the other side.<br \/>* No physical \"home\" button. There is a home button but it is a software button so only functions when phone is on and unlocked. I accept this as the trade off for a lower priced phone, but still would be nice to have.<br \/>* No ear phone jack. There is a USB C jack and the phone comes with a USB C to earphone jack adapter, so can use regular wired earphones. Also, can use bluetooth earphones. I have tested and it works well both ways.<br \/>* Can't remove battery.<br \/>* Would prefer a little smaller and lighter for pocket carrying, but is not too bad.<br \/><br \/>It's a nice phone.

I wanted to replace it with the same model phone, but the price for the Moto G7 (US version)  was $100.00 more than I previously paid just a year ago. I came across this international version and it was much cheaper, so I decided to give it a try. Firstly, it worked perfectly well with Mint Mobile. Secondly, transferring data from old phone to this new phone using Google backup went well without a hitch. Thirdly, the phone comes with an international charging plug and adapter to for US type plug. The seller also included a generic charger and cable. It also included a clear silicone cover to protect the phone. So far, I must admit this is a good price for a nice full-feature cell phone.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Don't Expect Tracfone to Honor the Warranty on this Phone","text":"I purchased this phone through Tracfone about 6 months ago. The wifi reception has never been great, but recently started to fail altogether. I called Tracfone to have them replace the phone, since it's under warranty for a year. They refused to replace it (I talked to three agents, escalating until I could escalate no more). They will only replace a phone if it can't make or receive calls, but other features of the phone (camera, wifi, etc.) may break and they won't act in these cases. The warranty doesn't make any exceptions, but Tracfone knows that they can get away with this, that one little customer isn't going to be able to sue them or prosecute. So, this is my small way of saying \"buyer beware.\" Once I use up my minutes (just bought 1000), I'm done with Tracfone. I can't support a company that won't keep their word, that won't abide by their own warranty.<br \/><br \/>If you do stick with Tracfone, buy a better used phone with better features than this one. It will have more processing power and a better screen. Tracfone now lets you bring your own device  [...]. But, their customer service is so horrible, I'm still not staying. Another example: it took 3 days to port my phone number on one Tracfone phone to another. This isn't a port from one provider to another, but one *Tracfone* phone to another Tracphone phone.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Lots of phone for the money","text":"For the price, this was the best phone I could get. It's my first android, and feels like a step down from my previous iphone, I bought 4 of these for my family, and we set 3 of them up in the last month. They are working well, and we are all relatively happy with them  I'm not used to the size, these are pretty big phones. I had a hard time finding a good protective case, the best I found is the Supcase. I often have to google how to do things with this phone, but most of them work out just fine. Biggest issues for me; no visual voicemail and the power button. For visual voicemail I downloaded YouMail, it seems to work ok. The power button is right in the middle of the phone's side, right where I place my thumb while speaking. It's also got a very light touch, way too easy to press, even with a heavy duty case. I cut people off constantly by shutting off the phone.Also wish for a physical do not disturb button that iphones have.  Favorite things for me: hand motions to shake flashlight and camera on, very handy. The huge 64 G memory is amazing, and expandable (unlike iphones). The battery life is good. Overall, this was a very good purchase for a great price","images":[],"asin":"B077Y8DN87","parent_asin":"B077Y8DN87","user_id":"AGLCYDZVAJ5TWD5JD7LBTJGRYPAA","timestamp":1524833099205,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":226,"phone_score":0.6370345354,"battery_score":0.6370345354,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.6370345354,"price_score":0.6370345354,"phones_score":0.6370345354,"life_score":0.6370345354,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.6370345354,"case_score":0.6370345354,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.6370345354,"app_score":0.6370345354,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.6370345354}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Dissapointing battery life and software performance","text":"As a management consultant who travels almost weekly, I was eagerly looking forward to having mobile email and internet and urged by my wife to get this phone when it came out. However, after nearly two years with this phone, I can't wait for my contract to be up. As an early adopter of the T-mobile G1, I have definitely felt all the downsides of a first generation product.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>- Physical keyboard is handy for texting and surfing the web.<br \/>- GPS and turn-by-turn navigation is free and helpful.<br \/>- Phone has good integration with Google email, calendar and other apps.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>- Everything (startup time, apps, navigation, camera) on this phone is extremely sloooooow.<br \/>- Software is buggy and phone shuts down unexpectedly at times.<br \/>- Battery life is abysmal, the worst on any phone ever. You will need to charge several times per day, particularly if you use Bluetooth or surf the web.<br \/>- Syncing of music and other files is primitive compared to iphone\/ipod and itunes.<br \/>- Lack of standard headphone jack is really annoying when traveling (and you want to listen to music and charge the phone at the same time).<br \/><br \/>I have a long-time friend who I met recently after many months and lo and behold he had only recently gotten his first smart phone, also a T-mobile G1, and it had even worse problems than mine. After asking him what he was thinking (he definitely should have asked me for my opinion!), I told him to make sure the software was at least up-to-date and that I wished him luck. My friend has a pretty laid-back lifestyle so he likes to crack jokes about the phone matching his pace. He is also more likely to see the phone's flaws as endearing \"idiosyncrasies\".<br \/><br \/>I still have a few months left on my contract but given how slow and buggy this phone is, I took out the SIM card and put it in one of the T-mobile \"to-go\" phones from Walmart. I am paying an extra $25 per month for the G1 service, but anything at this point is better than using this phone.<br \/><br \/>Recommendation: Don't Buy! Get a smartphone that works or a regular phone and 3G ipad (for mobile email and internet).","images":[],"asin":"B001JT1U1E","parent_asin":"B001JT1U1E","user_id":"AH5OFLMILKB2XOEFZ6LLNUVP2PFA","timestamp":1279781015000,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false,"review_length":384,"phone_score":0.9280803204,"battery_score":0.9280803204,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.9280803204,"price_score":0.0,"phones_score":0.9280803204,"life_score":0.9280803204,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.9280803204,"service_score":0.9280803204,"battery life_score":0.9280803204,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.9280803204,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9280803204,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.0}

Even my last phone with a fresh charge and fresh battery didn't compare to this.<br \/><br \/>Snapdragon 835 and 8GB of RAM. I ran benchmarks on this phone and it outperforms the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and LG V30. That makes me feel good because I care not for either of those companies.<br \/><br \/>People will complain about it not having a 3.5mm audio jack for headphones. Razer opted out on it to add 500 more mAh to the battery. It comes with a USB Type-C adapter with a 3.5mm audio jack that essentially only adds 4 inches of length to your headphone cable. This is a non-problem that babies will still complain about.<br \/><br \/>No bloatware. Hate it when major companies decide what I should have on my phone so this was a nice change of pace for once.<br \/><br \/>Camera software could use some work, but again this is a non-problem. I bought a camera app for $4 that improves it A LOT. If $4 is too much to spend after blowing $700+ on a phone then I don't know what to tell you. Some will say for $700 it should come with good camera software. I agree, but an extra $4 is really nitpicky.<br \/><br \/>Fingerprint reader is snappy and accurate. Instead of some lame circle on the back of the phone it's conveniently placed on the right side of the phone.<br \/><br \/>I've seen complaints that the volume buttons are too low, but don't understand why. Considering the size of this phone and the average size of human hands the buttons are placed just fine.<br \/><br \/>I can't think of anything bad to say about this phone. It's really a great piece of tech for a reasonable price.","images":[],"asin":"B077B91954","parent_asin":"B077B91954","user_id":"AGEHRZBHMFCFGLN3LBHDAX7VEFJQ","timestamp":1514992846445,"helpful_vote":28,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":339,"phone_score":0.9776585102,"battery_score":0.9776585102,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.9776585102,"price_score":0.9776585102,"phones_score":0.9776585102,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.0,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.0,"app_score":0.9776585102,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.0,"size_score":0.9776585102}

For the price, you think you would think you would be sacrificing a lot of features, but you would be wrong. You get a lovely 5.7\" inch display with an integrated speaker at the bottom, rugged construction, a fingerprint reader, NFC support, multiple cameras (including infrared), dual SIM support, SD card expansion, and stock Android 11.<br \/><br \/>The calling quality is great, and with dual SIM support you won't have to carry an extra device if you use two numbers. Stock Android is a dream because it has no bloat. You can put exactly what you want on it and you don't have to worry that unremovable bloat is taking up space you need.<br \/><br \/>The rugged construction is amazing. Your phone is well protected and you won't have to bother with putting a case on it  as it is well protected against drops and spills. It has facial recognition in addition to fingerprint login so you have two ways of password-free security. NFC means things like Google Pay will work. It has USB-C charging for fast charge and also for connecting the phone to portable monitors to extend or enlarge the display.<br \/><br \/>You get 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage plus support for SD cards so you will have room for almost any app you want. The camera has all the bells and whistles like infrared and macro support. All for under $200. If you want an advanced Android phone but don't want to pay upwards of $1000 for it then I would highly recommend this phone. Oh, and it is unlocked, so you can use it with any GSM provider.

The only problem I have is getting my HP laptop to recognize it via the HDMI charger cable, but I got a Bluetooth adapter for my computer to resolve that.<br \/><br \/>This is a fast phone with excellent performance and good (not great) cameras. Let's be honest, if you are serious about photography, you need to buy a camera, not just depend on your cellphone. But this certainly takes beautiful photos. All my photos on my @40rtyPluss Instagram account were taken on this or on my original BLU.<br \/><br \/>So far no complaints.","images":[],"asin":"B07FWNFT8L","parent_asin":"B07FWNFT8L","user_id":"AEHQOWODMPOUGWT4MIYKIJLNWSFQ","timestamp":1540499985461,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":true,"review_length":198,"phone_score":0.7781010866,"battery_score":0.0,"screen_score":0.0,"camera_score":0.7781010866,"price_score":0.7781010866,"phones_score":0.0,"life_score":0.0,"quality_score":0.7781010866,"apps_score":0.0,"service_score":0.0,"battery life_score":0.0,"case_score":0.0,"features_score":0.0,"mobile_score":0.0,"device_score":0.0,"memory_score":0.7781010866,"app_score":0.0,"wifi_score":0.0,"cell_score":0.7781010866,"size_score":0.0}
